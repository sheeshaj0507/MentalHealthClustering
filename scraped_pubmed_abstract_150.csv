clinical depression,Although anxiety and depression have been considered as two distinct entities according to the diagnostic criteria anxious depression comorbid anxiety and depression is relatively a common syndrome According to the DSM criteria it uses with anxious distress specifier to define anxious depression in its MDD section Anxious depression is known to have different neurobiological profiles compared to nonanxious depression Several studies have revealed significant differences between anxious depression and nonanxious depression regarding the hypothalamicpituitaryadrenal HPA axis function structural and functional brain imaging findings inflammation markers etc Patients with anxious depression were significantly more likely to be found in primary care setting and more likely to be associated with female gender nonsingle unemployed less educated and more severe depression Previous reports also showed that patients with anxious depression had more frequent episodes of major depression and a higher risk of suicidal ideation and previous suicide attempts than those with nonanxious depression
clinical depression,ObjectiveAdolescence is a formative and turbulent phase where physiological psychosocial and cognitive changes leave adolescents vulnerable to psychological disorders Given the lack of reviews that consolidate and compare worldwide prevalence of depression among adolescents this review aims to examine the global prevalence of major depressive disorders dysthymia and elevated depressive symptoms among adolescentsMethodsA systematic review and metaanalysis was conducted Six databases were searched for studies published from 2001 to December 2020 Seventytwo studies were included Subgroup analysis were performed for year of publication geographical region gender and assessment tools usedResultsThe global point prevalence rate of elevated selfreported depressive symptoms from 2001 to 2020 was CI Point prevalence for major depressive disorder MDD and dysthymia was CI and CI respectively The pooled oneyear prevalence and lifetime prevalence for MDD were CI and CI Point prevalence of elevated depressive symptoms among adolescents increased from CI between 2001 and 2010 to CI between
clinical depression,Major depressive disorder MDD is considered a serious public health issue that adversely impacts an individuals quality of life and contributes significantly to the global burden of disease The clinical heterogeneity that exists among patients limits the ability of MDD to be accurately diagnosed and currently a symptombased approach is utilized in many cases Due to the complex nature of this disorder and lack of precise knowledge regarding the pathophysiology effective management is challenging The aetiology and pathophysiology of MDD remain largely unknown given the complex genetic and environmental interactions that are involved Nonetheless the aetiology and pathophysiology of MDD have been the subject of extensive research and there is a vast body of literature that exists Here we overview the key hypotheses that have been proposed for the neurobiology of MDD and highlight the need for a unified model as many of these pathways are integrated Key pathways discussed
clinical depression,BackgroundBurnout and clinical depression have been variably viewed as synonymous or as distinctly differing entities but with few distinguishing features provided Failure to differentiate the two conditions can lead to compromised clinical management We sought to enhance the differentiation of burnout and clinical depression by assembling a list of candidate differentiating featuresMethodsIn assembling a set of distinguishing clinical features we compared burnout states against the two principal depressive subtypes ie melancholic and nonmelancholic depression rather than against major depression per se Our candidate features were assembled from a review of salient literature our clinical observations and from a subsample of subjects who selfidentified as having experienced both burnout and depression and who volunteered differentiating featuresResultsWe judged that burnout shares few features with melancholic depression While burnout and nonmelancholic depression share a set of symptoms differences were greater than commonalitiesLimitationsOur findings were based on clinical observation and exploratory research rather than
clinical depression,The interaction of physical and mental vulnerability and environmental constraints is thought to foster the development of psychiatric disorders such as major depressive disorder MDD A central factor in the development of psychopathology is mental stress Despite some evidence for parasympathetic withdrawal and sympathetic overactivity in MDD the psychophysiological response to stress in depression is not clearcut Given the growing interest in heart rate and heart rate variability as indicators for remote monitoring of patients it is important to understand how patients with MDD react to stress in a laboratorycontrolled environment We conducted a systematic review of studies using electrocardiography to derive heart rate and heart rate variability during stress in patients with clinical depression We focused on wellvalidated stress tasks the mental arithmetic stress task the Trier social stress task and public speaking task to minimize confounding effects due to the nature of the stressor The majority of studies

clinical depression,Major Depressive Disorder MDD is common among cancer patients with prevalence rates up to fourtimes higher than the general population Depression confers worse outcomes including nonadherence to treatment and increased mortality in the oncology setting Advances in the understanding of neurobiological underpinnings of depression have revealed shared biobehavioral mechanisms may contribute to cancer progression Moreover psychosocial stressors in cancer promote inflammation and oxidativenitrosative stress a decreased immunosurveillance and a dysfunctional activation of the autonomic nervous system and of the hypothalamicpituitaryadrenal axis Consequently the prompt recognition of depression among patients with cancer who may benefit of treatment strategies targeting depressive symptoms cognitive dysfunction fatigue and sleep disturbances is a public health priority Moreover behavioral strategies aiming at reducing psychological distress and depressive symptoms including addressing unhealthy diet and lifestyle choices as well as physical inactivity and sleep dysfunction may represent important strategies not only to treat depression but also to improve
clinical depression,Cognitive dysfunction is prevalent in patients with major depressive disorder MDD with deficits observed across several domains eg executive function memory attention While depression alone is disabling patients with cognitive deficits typically experience greater functional impairments poorer clinical recovery and reduced quality of life Consequently it is imperative to elucidate recent advances in our understanding of the treatment of cognitive dysfunction in MDD Areas covered This review spans psychological physical and pharmacological treatment approaches for cognitive dysfunction in depression Where possible the authors summarise where treatments have demonstrated efficacy in improving specific cognitive domains eg attention and highlight the differential mechanisms which underpin cognitive improvement In addition the roles of adjunctive cognitive treatments eg exercise and the possible side effects and drawbacks of specific treatments are explored Expert opinion Psychological treatments typically confer cognitive improvement alongside functional andor clinical recovery however the efficacy of cognitive training and cognitive behavioral therapy
clinical depression,Millions of people worldwide suffer from depression but despite advances in pharmacological therapies many patients do not experience symptomatic remission or treatment response even after treatments with several medications As such there is an urgent need to identify biomarkers that can not only predict the treatment response but also allow a rational selection of optimal therapy for each patient Areas covered This review examines the recent findings coming from different omic sciences in human bloodbased biomarkers associated with antidepressant treatment response with particular attention on geneticepigenetic and biochemical biomarkers Specific emphasis will be placed on key molecules related to neuroplasticity and inflammation because of their involvement in the pathophysiology of depression and antidepressant response Expert commentary Biomarker identification is still an ongoing work Indeed to date no biomarkers have sufficiently proven specificity sensitivity and reproducibility to be used in the clinical setting However omic approaches hold great promise in identifying
clinical depression,The changes in diagnostic criteria for major depressive disorder MDD from the fourth to the fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders DSM may appear small but have important consequences for how the diagnosis is used In DSM MDD is part of the new Depressive disorders section which is separate from Bipolar disorders marking a division in what had been known as Mood disorders A small wording change has expanded the core mood criterion to include hopelessness potentially broadening the diagnosis The replacement of an operationalized bereavement exclusion with a call for clinical judgment in distinguishing normal reactions to significant loss from a disorder in need of clinical attention makes the diagnosis less objective and complicates investigations of the relationship between adversity and depression A new persistent depressive disorder category is intended to encompass both dysthymia and chronic depression but its relationship to MDD is ambiguous
clinical depression,Cognitive impairment is a common often persistent symptom of major depressive disorder MDD that is disproportionately represented in patients who have not returned to full psychosocial functioning The ultimate goal of treatment in depression is full functional recovery and assessing patients for cognitive impairment and selecting treatments that address cognitive dysfunction should lead to improved functional outcomes Unfortunately many clinicians use screening and assessment tools that are not suited for measuring cognitive impairment in patients with depression The new THINCit assessment tool is the first instrument that provides objective and subjective data on dysfunction in all the cognitive domains commonly affected by depression In regard to treatment several pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic interventions have been investigated as treatments for cognitive dysfunction in individuals with MDD However very few studies of treatments for cognitive function in patients with MDD have been adequate in terms of sample size and study methods to guide
clinical depression,Pleasure and motivation are important factors for goaldirected behavior and wellbeing in both animals and humans Intact hedonic capacity requires an undisturbed interplay between a number of different brain regions and transmitter systems Concordantly dysfunction of networks encoding for reward have been shown in depression and other psychiatric disorders The development of technological possibilities to investigate connectivity on a functional level in humans and to directly influence networks in animals using optogenetics among other techniques has provided new important insights in this field of researchIn this review we aim to provide an overview on the neurobiological substrates of anhedonia on a network level For this purpose definition of anhedonia and the involved reward components are described first then current data on reward networks in healthy individuals and in depressed patients are summarized and the roles of different neurotransmitter systems involved in reward processing are specified Based on this information the
clinical depression,Depression clinical interview corpora are essential for advancing automated depression diagnosis While previous studies have used written speech material in controlled settings these materials do not accurately represent spontaneous conversational speech Additionally selfreported measures of depression are subject to bias making the data unreliable for training models for realworld scenarios This study introduces a new corpus of depression clinical interviews collected directly from a psychiatric hospital containing recordings with healthy and depressive patients The subjects were examined using the MontgomeryAsberg Depression Rating Scale MADRS in Chinese Their final diagnosis was based on medical evaluations through a clinical interview conducted by a psychiatry specialist All interviews were audiorecorded and transcribed verbatim and annotated by experienced physicians This dataset is a valuable resource for automated depression detection research and is expected to advance the field of psychology Baseline models for detecting and predicting depression presence and level were built and descriptive statistics

clinical depression,Mental disorders are rapidly increasing each year and have become a major challenge affecting the social and financial wellbeing of individuals There is a need for phenotypic characterization of psychiatric disorders with biomarkers to provide a rich signature for Major Depressive Disorder improving the understanding of the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying these mental disorders This comprehensive review focuses on depression and relapse detection modalities such as selfquestionnaires audiovisuals and EEG highlighting noteworthy publications in the last ten years The article concentrates on the literature that adopts machine learning by audiovisual and EEG signals It also outlines preprocessing feature extraction and public datasets for depression detection The review concludes with recommendations that will help improve the reliability of developed models and the determinism of computational intelligencebased systems in psychiatry To the best of our knowledge this survey is the first comprehensive review on depression and relapse prediction by selfquestionnaires audiovisual and EEGbased
clinical depression,BackgroundSymptom severity as a moderator of treatment response has been the subject of debate over the past years Each of the meta and megaanalyses examining the treatment significance of depression severity used the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale HAMD wholly or in part to define severity though the cutoff used to define severe depression varied There is limited empirical research establishing cutoff scores for bands of severity on the HAMD The goal of the study is to empirically establish cutoff scores on the HAMD in their allocation of patients to severity groupsMethodsSix hundred twentyseven outpatients with current major depressive disorder were evaluated with a semistructured diagnostic interview Scores on the item HAMD were derived from ratings according to the conversion method described by Endicott et al 1981 The patients were also rated on the Clinical Global Index of Severity CGI Receiver operating curves were computed to identify the cutoff that optimally
clinical depression,discriminated between patients with mild vs moderate and moderate vs severe depressionResultsHAMD scores were significantly lower in patients with mild depression than patients with moderate depression and patients with moderate depression scored significantly lower than patients with severe depression The cutoff score on the HAMD that maximized the sum of sensitivity and specificity was for the comparison of mild vs moderate depression and for the comparison of moderate vs severe depressionLimitationsThe present study was conducted in a single outpatient practice in which the majority of patients were white female and had health insurance Although the study was limited to a single site a strength of the recruitment procedure was that the sample was not selected for participation in a treatment study and exclusion and inclusion criteria did not reduce the representativeness of the patient groups The analyses were based on HAMD scores extracted from ratings on the SADS However we

clinical depression,BackgroundReverse translating putative biomarkers of depression from patients to animals is complex because Major Depressive Disorder MDD is a highly heterogenous condition This review proposes an approach to reverse translation based on relating relevant biobehavioural functions in laboratory rodents to MDD symptomsMethodsThis systematic review outlines symptom clusters assessed by psychometric tests of MDD and antidepressant treatment response including the Montgomerysberg Depression Rating Scale the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale and the Beck Depression Inventory Symptoms were related to relevant behavioural assays in laboratory rodentsResultsThe resulting battery of tests includes passive coping anxietylike behaviours sleep caloric intake cognition psychomotor functions hedonic reactivity and aversive learning These assays are discussed alongside relevant clinical symptoms of MDD providing a framework through which reverse translation of a biomarker can be interpretedLimitationsCertain aspects of MDD may not be quantified by tests in laboratory rodents and their biological significance may not always be of clinical relevanceConclusionsUsing this
clinical depression,Although depression is the leading cause of disability worldwide current understanding of the neurobiology of depression has failed to be translated into clinical practice Major depressive disorder MDD pathogenesis is considered to be significantly influenced by multiple risk genes however genetic effects are not simply expressed at a behavioral level Therefore the concept of endophenotype has been applied in psychiatric genetics Imaging genetics applies anatomical or functional imaging technologies as phenotypic assays to evaluate genetic variation and their impact on behavior This paper attempts to provide a comprehensive review of available imaging genetics studies including reports on genetic variants that have most frequently been linked to MDD such as the monoaminergic genes serotonin transporter gene monoamine oxidase A gene tryptophan hydroxylase gene serotonin receptor 1A gene and catecholOmethyl transferase gene with regard to key structures involved in emotion processing such as the hippocampus amygdala anterior cingulate cortex and orbitofrontal cortex
clinical depression,Major depressive disorder is a common psychiatric illness At present there are no objective nonverbal automated markers that can reliably track treatment response Here we explore the use of video analysis of facial expressivity in a cohort of severely depressed patients before and after deep brain stimulation DBS an experimental treatment for depression We introduced a set of variability measurements to obtain unsupervised features from muted video recordings which were then leveraged to build predictive models to classify three levels of severity in the patients recovery from depression Multiscale entropy was utilized to estimate the variability in pixel intensity level at various time scales A dynamic latent variable model was utilized to learn a lowdimensional representation of factors that describe the dynamic relationship between highdimensional pixels in each video frame and over time Finally a novel elastic net ordinal regression model was trained to predict the severity of depression as

clinical depression,BackgroundImpaired social adjustment in depression has been associated with clinical variables although results have been inconsistent Previous research has not examined how social adjustment in depression varies by source of sample clinical vs community or the associations with personalityMethodsA total of depressed outpatients from two samples completed the Social Adjustment Scale and were assessed on a number of clinical variables including depression severity age duration of depression and personality symptomsResultsOverall social adjustment scores in our clinical samples were similar to those of an overseas clinical sample although there were some differences by subscales In addition the social adjustment scores of our clinical sample were significantly more impaired than those of individuals identified as depressed from a local epidemiological sample Finally in multiple regression equations social adjustment scores were predicted by the clinical variables severity of depression younger age and personality symptoms However these only explained a small amount of variance
clinical depression,Attentional impairment in depression is a cardinal feature of depression and has been proposed as a candidate endophenotype for major depressive disorder Eventrelated potentials ERPs elicited by oddball signal detection tasks provide objective markers of selective stimulus processing and are pertinent endophenotypic markers for depression While previous studies have sought to determine objective markers for attentional impairment in depression evidence is inconsistent and may involve heterogeneity in relatively small samples Here we brought together oddball ERP recording with source localization of neural correlates of selective attention in outpatients with major depressive disorder MDD n and participants with depressed mood PDM n relative to healthy controls CTL n The key finding was a dimensional exaggeration of the P200 ms to both target signal and nontarget noise stimuli most pronounced in MDD followed by PDM relative to CTL This exaggeration was coupled with slower and more variable response times suggesting that neural

clinical depression,Major depressive disorder MDD is considered a serious public health issue that adversely impacts an individuals quality of life and contributes significantly to the global burden of disease The clinical heterogeneity that exists among patients limits the ability of MDD to be accurately diagnosed and currently a symptombased approach is utilized in many cases Due to the complex nature of this disorder and lack of precise knowledge regarding the pathophysiology effective management is challenging The aetiology and pathophysiology of MDD remain largely unknown given the complex genetic and environmental interactions that are involved Nonetheless the aetiology and pathophysiology of MDD have been the subject of extensive research and there is a vast body of literature that exists Here we overview the key hypotheses that have been proposed for the neurobiology of MDD and highlight the need for a unified model as many of these pathways are integrated Key pathways discussed
clinical depression,BackgroundBurnout and clinical depression have been variably viewed as synonymous or as distinctly differing entities but with few distinguishing features provided Failure to differentiate the two conditions can lead to compromised clinical management We sought to enhance the differentiation of burnout and clinical depression by assembling a list of candidate differentiating featuresMethodsIn assembling a set of distinguishing clinical features we compared burnout states against the two principal depressive subtypes ie melancholic and nonmelancholic depression rather than against major depression per se Our candidate features were assembled from a review of salient literature our clinical observations and from a subsample of subjects who selfidentified as having experienced both burnout and depression and who volunteered differentiating featuresResultsWe judged that burnout shares few features with melancholic depression While burnout and nonmelancholic depression share a set of symptoms differences were greater than commonalitiesLimitationsOur findings were based on clinical observation and exploratory research rather than
clinical depression,The interaction of physical and mental vulnerability and environmental constraints is thought to foster the development of psychiatric disorders such as major depressive disorder MDD A central factor in the development of psychopathology is mental stress Despite some evidence for parasympathetic withdrawal and sympathetic overactivity in MDD the psychophysiological response to stress in depression is not clearcut Given the growing interest in heart rate and heart rate variability as indicators for remote monitoring of patients it is important to understand how patients with MDD react to stress in a laboratorycontrolled environment We conducted a systematic review of studies using electrocardiography to derive heart rate and heart rate variability during stress in patients with clinical depression We focused on wellvalidated stress tasks the mental arithmetic stress task the Trier social stress task and public speaking task to minimize confounding effects due to the nature of the stressor The majority of studies

clinical depression,The changes in diagnostic criteria for major depressive disorder MDD from the fourth to the fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders DSM may appear small but have important consequences for how the diagnosis is used In DSM MDD is part of the new Depressive disorders section which is separate from Bipolar disorders marking a division in what had been known as Mood disorders A small wording change has expanded the core mood criterion to include hopelessness potentially broadening the diagnosis The replacement of an operationalized bereavement exclusion with a call for clinical judgment in distinguishing normal reactions to significant loss from a disorder in need of clinical attention makes the diagnosis less objective and complicates investigations of the relationship between adversity and depression A new persistent depressive disorder category is intended to encompass both dysthymia and chronic depression but its relationship to MDD is ambiguous
clinical depression,Cognitive impairment is a common often persistent symptom of major depressive disorder MDD that is disproportionately represented in patients who have not returned to full psychosocial functioning The ultimate goal of treatment in depression is full functional recovery and assessing patients for cognitive impairment and selecting treatments that address cognitive dysfunction should lead to improved functional outcomes Unfortunately many clinicians use screening and assessment tools that are not suited for measuring cognitive impairment in patients with depression The new THINCit assessment tool is the first instrument that provides objective and subjective data on dysfunction in all the cognitive domains commonly affected by depression In regard to treatment several pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic interventions have been investigated as treatments for cognitive dysfunction in individuals with MDD However very few studies of treatments for cognitive function in patients with MDD have been adequate in terms of sample size and study methods to guide

clinical depression,BackgroundReverse translating putative biomarkers of depression from patients to animals is complex because Major Depressive Disorder MDD is a highly heterogenous condition This review proposes an approach to reverse translation based on relating relevant biobehavioural functions in laboratory rodents to MDD symptomsMethodsThis systematic review outlines symptom clusters assessed by psychometric tests of MDD and antidepressant treatment response including the Montgomerysberg Depression Rating Scale the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale and the Beck Depression Inventory Symptoms were related to relevant behavioural assays in laboratory rodentsResultsThe resulting battery of tests includes passive coping anxietylike behaviours sleep caloric intake cognition psychomotor functions hedonic reactivity and aversive learning These assays are discussed alongside relevant clinical symptoms of MDD providing a framework through which reverse translation of a biomarker can be interpretedLimitationsCertain aspects of MDD may not be quantified by tests in laboratory rodents and their biological significance may not always be of clinical relevanceConclusionsUsing this
clinical depression,Although depression is the leading cause of disability worldwide current understanding of the neurobiology of depression has failed to be translated into clinical practice Major depressive disorder MDD pathogenesis is considered to be significantly influenced by multiple risk genes however genetic effects are not simply expressed at a behavioral level Therefore the concept of endophenotype has been applied in psychiatric genetics Imaging genetics applies anatomical or functional imaging technologies as phenotypic assays to evaluate genetic variation and their impact on behavior This paper attempts to provide a comprehensive review of available imaging genetics studies including reports on genetic variants that have most frequently been linked to MDD such as the monoaminergic genes serotonin transporter gene monoamine oxidase A gene tryptophan hydroxylase gene serotonin receptor 1A gene and catecholOmethyl transferase gene with regard to key structures involved in emotion processing such as the hippocampus amygdala anterior cingulate cortex and orbitofrontal cortex

clinical depression,Major depressive disorder is a leading global cause of disability There is a growing interest for memory in mood disorders since it might constitute an original tool for prevention diagnosis and treatment MDD is associated with impaired autobiographical memory characterized by a tendency to overgeneral memory rather than vivid episodic selfdefining memory which is mandatory for problemsolving and projection in the future This memory bias is maintained by three mechanisms ruminations avoidance and impaired executive control If we adopt a broader and comprehensive perspective we can hypothesize that all those alterations have the potential to impair selfidentity updating We posit that this update requires a double referencing process to internalized selfrepresentation and to an externalized framework dealing with the representation of the consequence of actions Diagnostic and therapeutic implications are discussed in the light of this model and the importance of assessing autobiographical memory in MDD is highlighted This article

clinical depression,Major depressive disorder MDD is considered a serious public health issue that adversely impacts an individuals quality of life and contributes significantly to the global burden of disease The clinical heterogeneity that exists among patients limits the ability of MDD to be accurately diagnosed and currently a symptombased approach is utilized in many cases Due to the complex nature of this disorder and lack of precise knowledge regarding the pathophysiology effective management is challenging The aetiology and pathophysiology of MDD remain largely unknown given the complex genetic and environmental interactions that are involved Nonetheless the aetiology and pathophysiology of MDD have been the subject of extensive research and there is a vast body of literature that exists Here we overview the key hypotheses that have been proposed for the neurobiology of MDD and highlight the need for a unified model as many of these pathways are integrated Key pathways discussed

clinical depression,The changes in diagnostic criteria for major depressive disorder MDD from the fourth to the fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders DSM may appear small but have important consequences for how the diagnosis is used In DSM MDD is part of the new Depressive disorders section which is separate from Bipolar disorders marking a division in what had been known as Mood disorders A small wording change has expanded the core mood criterion to include hopelessness potentially broadening the diagnosis The replacement of an operationalized bereavement exclusion with a call for clinical judgment in distinguishing normal reactions to significant loss from a disorder in need of clinical attention makes the diagnosis less objective and complicates investigations of the relationship between adversity and depression A new persistent depressive disorder category is intended to encompass both dysthymia and chronic depression but its relationship to MDD is ambiguous
clinical depression,Cognitive impairment is a common often persistent symptom of major depressive disorder MDD that is disproportionately represented in patients who have not returned to full psychosocial functioning The ultimate goal of treatment in depression is full functional recovery and assessing patients for cognitive impairment and selecting treatments that address cognitive dysfunction should lead to improved functional outcomes Unfortunately many clinicians use screening and assessment tools that are not suited for measuring cognitive impairment in patients with depression The new THINCit assessment tool is the first instrument that provides objective and subjective data on dysfunction in all the cognitive domains commonly affected by depression In regard to treatment several pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic interventions have been investigated as treatments for cognitive dysfunction in individuals with MDD However very few studies of treatments for cognitive function in patients with MDD have been adequate in terms of sample size and study methods to guide

bipolar disorder,Current diagnostic criteria define bipolar I BP I and bipolar II BP II disorders as distinct conditions differing only slightly by clinical features This review seeks to identify commonalities and differentiating features across the two subtypes and emphasize that differences in causes and treatments are likely to be highly dependent on the diagnostic criteria used to define and differentiate the two conditions We undertake a literature review of candidate clinical features that might be anticipated to vary or be shared across BP I and BP II disorders and consider the impact of DSM definition on such applied findings Studies respecting DSMIV differentiation of BP I and BP II disorders have generated relatively few differences across the conditions which may reflect definitional similarity or commonalities across the two conditions As DSM decision rules are similar to those used by DSMIV to differentiate BP I and BP II disorders we argue for
bipolar disorder,Bipolar disorder is known to be highly recurrent and people with bipolar illnesses often experience high degrees of interpersonal and social impairment The emergence of prodromal symptoms not only causes distress but may also predispose patients to greater risk of a full relapse Studies have found that patients can report prodromes reliably Common mania prodromes include decreased need for sleep increased activities being more sociable and racing thoughts while common depression prodromes are loss of interest not being able to put worries aside and interrupted sleep Furthermore patients coping with prodromal symptoms predicted relapses in bipolar disorder These findings have led to a handful of randomized controlled studies which aimed at teaching patients relevant and adaptive coping strategies in dealing with bipolar prodromes as part of the intervention strategies and the results are very encouraging The packages in these studies are of different complexity The mode of intervention also varied

bipolar disorder,Although epidemiologic figures place the lifetime prevalence of bipolar disorders at about current evidence indicates that the spectrum of bipolar disorders may account for of the general population This summarizes two decades of research conducted by the author and other investigators that supports the existence of such a spectrum that at the one extreme merges with severe psychotic disorder and at the other with temperamental dysregulation The enlargement of the territory of bipolar disorders is due to new data that have validated mixed rapid cycling and soft bipolar conditions The hallmark of bipolar I disorders is mania extreme psychotic pictures often emerge when mania is mixed with depression giving rise to dysphoric mania Attenuated or soft bipolar conditions refer to major depressive episodes interspersed with milder hypomanic excursions the latter may occur spontaneously or upon pharmacologic challenge with antidepressants Bipolar II disorder is often characterized by cyclothymic intermorbid or premorbid
bipolar disorder,The chronic longterm evolution of bipolar disorder BD requires a careful clinical characterization with prognostic implications in terms of symptom and functional control The OPTHYMUM multicenter study was conducted in France with the objective of evaluating residual symptoms on overall functioning of BD patients during interepisodic period The aims of the present study were to identify the potentially modifiable eg treatable and nonmodifiable variables associated with functional impairment during the interepisodic periods of BD Sample was divided into two groups according to level of functioning adequate vs impaired based on the FAST scale total score FAST cutoff for functional impairment is a score The two subgroups were compared as per sociodemographic and clinical variables with standard univariate analyses and a logistic regression model was created The model as a whole contained independent nonmodifiable factors age gender BD type illness duration and modifiable factors illness severity predominant polarity depressive and manic
bipolar disorder,The monitoring of patients by themselves and their caregivers is very important in the prophylaxis of bipolar disorder This study aimed to develop a Chineselanguage version of an instrument for assessment of manic and depressive symptoms by patients and their families Fiftyeight inpatients and outpatients with a DSMIV Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders diagnosis of bipolar disorder were recruited All subjects underwent clinical psychopathologic assessment by experienced psychiatrists using the Young Mania Rating Scale YMRS and the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale HDRS At the same time each patient and key family members filled out the Chineselanguage version of the Internal State Scale ISS for monitoring mental symptoms Patients were examined a second time if they had entered remission or a new episode of the opposite polarity The ISS was divided into two subscales of wellbeingactivation and of irritability Patients wellbeingactivation and irritability subscales were significantly correlated with YMRS
bipolar disorder,ObjectiveThe manic spectrum is thought to be characterized by a hypersensitive biobehavioral reward system the behavioral activation system Evidence for this framework comes from questionnairebased selfreport data collected in crosssectional and prospective studies of mania mania in remission and proneness to hypomania and from functional neuroimaging investigations of brain reward circuit activity during incentivized choice protocols Although heightened reward anticipation is consistently documented the status of later goal attainment activity hedonic responses and satiety reactions is less clear This report examines the status of such reward receipt processes as they operate in the manic spectrumMethodsA case report of a typical subject with bipolar II disorder with a hyperthymic temperament is presented using longitudinal biographical dataResultsDiminished reward receipt pleasure and satiety were demonstrated indicating impaired hedonic processing in hyperthymic temperament This impairment indicates a dissociation between early intensified reward pursuit processes and later blunted reward attainment activityConclusionsThe experience and neural correlates
bipolar disorder,Growing evidence indicates that risk for bipolar disorder is characterized by elevated activation in a frontostriatal reward neural circuit involving the ventral striatum and orbitofrontal cortex among other regions It is proposed that individuals with abnormally elevated rewardrelated neural activation are at risk for experiencing an excessive increase in approachrelated motivation during life events involving rewards or goal striving and attainment In the extreme this increase in motivation is reflected in hypomanicmanic symptoms By contrast unipolar depression without a history of hypomaniamania is characterized by decreased reward responsivity and decreased rewardrelated neural activation Collectively this suggests that risk for bipolar disorder and unipolar depression are characterized by distinct and opposite profiles of reward processing and rewardrelated neural activation The objective of the present paper is threefold First we review the literature on reward processing and rewardrelated neural activation in bipolar disorder and in particular risk for hypomaniamania Second we propose

bipolar disorder,The concept of prevention is not new to psychiatry and has long been recognized in general medicine Recent evidence has highlighted that early pharmacological and psychosocial treatment dramatically ameliorates poor prognosis and outcome for individuals with psychotic disorders reducing conversion rates to fullblown illness and decreasing symptom severity Nevertheless despite the many recent advances in our thinking about early intervention the need for early intervention in bipolar disorder BPD is an area that has been relatively neglected This review attempts to synthesize what is currently known about early intervention in BPD We discuss methodological issues pertaining to this topic review clinical studies that focus on highrisk subjects as well as firstepisode patients and review findings from brain imaging studies in the offspring of individuals with BPD as well as in firstepisode patients A companion paper discusses the cellular and molecular mechanisms of action of agents with neurotrophic and neuroplastic properties
bipolar disorder,Bipolar disorder is a chronic and often devastating illness that may go undiagnosed because of its complex and diverse presentation Clinicians can provide psychological treatments in conjunction with pharmacotherapy that can reduce the frequency severity and duration of manic and depressive episodes Because bipolar disorder is characterized by high degrees of comorbidity and high rates of medical complications the clinician will frequently need to implement other treatments targeted to comorbid conditions such as panic generalized anxiety substance abuse and personality disorders This article introduces the issue of Journal of Clinical Psychology In Session devoted to the treatment of bipolar disorder We describe the cognitive styles and personal vulnerabilities that pose greater risk for bipolar disorder Three evidencebased psychological treatments interpersonal social rhythm therapy familyfocused treatment and cognitivebehavioral therapy and current pharmacological treatments are examined and illustrated Finally we review the effectiveness and practice implications of a variety of treatments for
bipolar disorder,AimsEstimates of the occurrence of bipolar disorder among adolescents vary from country to country and from time to time Long delays from first symptoms to diagnosis of bipolar disorder have been suggested Studies among adults suggest increased mortality particularly due to suicide and cardiovascular diseases We set out to study the prognosis of adolescent onset bipolar disorder in terms of rehospitalizations diagnostic stability and mortalityMethodsThe study comprised a registerbased followup of all adolescents admitted to psychiatric inpatient care for the first time in their lives at age during the period 19802010 They were followed up in the National Care Register for Health Care and Causes of death registers until December 2014ResultsIncidence of bipolar disorder among to yearold adolescents over the whole study period was per same aged adolescents and across decades the incidence increased sixfold Patients with bipolar disorder during their firstever inpatient treatment were rehospitalized more often than those
bipolar disorder,ObjectivesTo identify clinical characteristics and adverse outcomes associated with an earlier age of onset of bipolar disorderMethodsA comprehensive search yielded empirical papers comparing clinical presentation and outcomes in individuals with bipolar disorder grouped according to age of onset total N The following variables were examined to determine odds ratios ORs and confidence intervals CIs presence of Axis I comorbidity rapid cycling psychotic symptoms mixed episodes DSMIV lifetime suicide attempts lifetime alcohol and substance abuse symptom severity and treatment delayResultsEarly age of onset was found to be associated with longer delay to treatment Hedges g P greater severity of depression Hedges g P and higher levels of comorbid anxiety OR P and substance use OR P Surprisingly no association was found between early age of onset and clinical characteristics such as psychotic symptoms or mixed episodes as defined by DSMIVConclusionsEarlier age of onset of bipolar disorder is associated with factors that
bipolar disorder,This paper sets out possible links between disruption of circadian rhythms in bipolar disorder and the affective symptom which are experienced in this disorder Evidence is drawn from Healy and Williams Psychiatr Dev 1989 review of circadian function in manic depression along with later reports which indicate a role for disrupted circadian rhythms in both depressed and manic phases of manic depression bipolar disorder This is integrated within a version of the multilevel model of emotion proposed by Power and Dalgleish Cognition and emotion from order to disorder Hove Psychology Press 1997 Behav Cognit Psychother 1999 The aim of this process is to propose a possible psychological mechanism by which the disruption of circadian rhythms might result in the observed clinical symptoms of bipolar disorder The integration of these approaches leads to a number of specific testable hypotheses that are relevant to future research into the psychological treatment and understanding
bipolar disorder,BackgroundThe longterm outcomes of bipolar disorder range from lasting remission to chronic course or frequent recurrences requiring admissions The distinction between bipolar I and II disorders has limited utility in outcome prediction It is unclear to what extent the clinical course of bipolar disorder predicts longterm outcomesMethodsA representative sample of individuals diagnosed with bipolar I or II disorder was recruited and followed for up to years using a lifechart method We previously described the clinical course over the first months with dimensional course characteristics and latent classes Now we test if these course characteristics predict longterm outcomes including time ill time with any mood symptoms and hospital admissions over a second nonoverlapping followup period in individuals with available data from both months and years followupsResultsDimensional course characteristics from the first months prospectively predicted outcomes over the following years The proportion of time depressed the severity of depressive symptoms and the
bipolar disorder,BackgroundOver the past years the evidence regarding pediatric bipolar disorder BP has increased substantially As a result recent concerns have focused primarily on prevalence and differential diagnosisMethodSelective review of the literatureResultsBP as defined by rigorously applying diagnostic criteria has been observed among children and especially adolescents in numerous countries In contrast to increasing diagnoses in clinical settings prevalence in epidemiologic studies has not recently changed BPspectrum conditions among youth are highly impairing and confer high risk for conversion to BPI and BPII Compared to adults youth with BP have more mixed symptoms more changes in mood polarity are more often symptomatic and seem to have worse prognosis The course clinical characteristics and comorbidities of BP among children and adolescents are in many ways otherwise similar to those of adults with BP Nonetheless many youth with BP receive no treatment and most do not receive BPspecific treatmentConclusionDespite increased evidence supporting the
bipolar disorder,ObjectiveClinical staging has increasingly been considered suitable for psychiatric disorders such as bipolar disorder A staging model of bipolar disorder could help clinicians understand the mechanisms underlying the course of the illness and guide prognosis and therapy This study aimed to investigate differences in functional status and cognitive functioning in patients in different clinical stages of bipolar disorderMethodSubjects who met DSMIV criteria for bipolar disorder n were recruited from the Bipolar Disorders Program at Hospital de Clnicas de Porto Alegre Brazil from October 2012 to October 2013 All patients had been in remission score on the item HDRS and the YMRS for at least month before assessment They were classified into clinical stages according to the model described by Kapczinski et al and compared to healthy controls Functional status was assessed by using the Functioning Assessment Short Test FAST Neuropsychological measures were performed to investigate cognitive functioningResultsSignificant differences in functional

bipolar disorder,Based on the recommendations of the subworkgroup on trauma and dissociative disorders the American Psychiatric Association APA removed the bereavement exclusion from the criteria for major depression in DSM In addition proposed DSM research criteria for persistent complex bereavement disorder PCBD were included in the new manual in a section for conditions and criteria needing further research We describe a case that warranted such a diagnosis The patient was a yearold woman who was admitted to the inpatient unit of our clinic on the birthday of her son who had died months earlier She was diagnosed with a manic episode with psychotic symptoms according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders Fourth Edition Text Revision DSMIVTR criteria and was treated accordingly Three months after discharge she made a suicide attempt and was admitted and reassessed During this admission she completed the Inventory of Complicated Grief ICG the MoodSpectrum
bipolar disorder,ObjectiveThe manic spectrum is thought to be characterized by a hypersensitive biobehavioral reward system the behavioral activation system Evidence for this framework comes from questionnairebased selfreport data collected in crosssectional and prospective studies of mania mania in remission and proneness to hypomania and from functional neuroimaging investigations of brain reward circuit activity during incentivized choice protocols Although heightened reward anticipation is consistently documented the status of later goal attainment activity hedonic responses and satiety reactions is less clear This report examines the status of such reward receipt processes as they operate in the manic spectrumMethodsA case report of a typical subject with bipolar II disorder with a hyperthymic temperament is presented using longitudinal biographical dataResultsDiminished reward receipt pleasure and satiety were demonstrated indicating impaired hedonic processing in hyperthymic temperament This impairment indicates a dissociation between early intensified reward pursuit processes and later blunted reward attainment activityConclusionsThe experience and neural correlates

bipolar disorder,ObjectivesPaediatric bipolar disorder bipolar disorder occurring in prepubertal children is a diagnosis subject to considerable controversy Whilst historically considered to be very rare proponents since the 1990s have argued that mania can present differently in children and as such is much more common than previously thought Such proposals raise questions about the validity of proposed phenotypes and potential risks of iatrogenic harmMethodsI critically examine the construct of paediatric bipolar disorder using Robins and Guzes 1970American Journal of Psychiatry126 influential criteria for the validity of a psychiatric diagnosis I review in turn evidence relating to its clinical description delimitation from other conditions followup studies family studies laboratory studies and treatment responseResultsAcross domains existing research highlights significant challenges establishing the diagnosis This includes significant heterogeneity in operationalising criteria for children variable or poor interrater reliability difficulty distinguishing paediatric bipolar disorder from other conditions large differences in rates of diagnosis between the United
bipolar disorder,People with bipolar disorder frequently experience persistent residual symptoms problems in psychosocial functioning cognitive impairment and poor quality of life In the last decade the treatment target in clinical and research settings has focused not only on clinical remission but also on functional recovery and more lately in personal recovery taking into account patients wellbeing and quality of life Hence the trend in psychiatry and psychology is to treat bipolar disorder in an integrative and holistic manner This literature review offers an overview regarding psychosocial functioning in bipolar disorder First a brief summary is provided regarding the definition of psychosocial functioning and the tools to measure it Then the most reported variables influencing the functional outcome in patients with bipolar disorder are listed Thereafter we include a section discussing therapies with proven efficacy at enhancing functional outcomes Other possible therapies that could be useful to prevent functional decline and improve
bipolar disorder,Bipolar disorder BPD is a potentially lifelong condition characterised by extreme changes in mood that may begin in childhood and cause substantial impairment Over the past decades BPD has been the focus of increased attention mainly due to controversies surrounding its prevalence diagnosis and treatment in children and adolescents This report addresses these controversies by reviewing the extant evidence base providing clinicians with a summary of the literature on diagnosis phenomenology and treatment of paediatric BPD The debate regarding diagnosing children with BPD based on severe irritability and aggression is mostly resolved The current data support utilising the diagnostic criteria based on episodic changes of mood polarity Therefore longitudinal course of illness should be explored in detail when diagnosing BPD Given high rates of genetic predisposition for BPD assessment of youth should focus on obtaining accurate family history of this condition Additionally there has been a substantial increase in randomised
bipolar disorder,Bipolar disorder is a lifelong mood disorder characterized by extreme mood swings between mania and depression Despite fitness costs associated with increased mortality and significant impairment bipolar disorder has persisted in the population with a high heritability and a stable prevalence Creativity and other positive traits have repeatedly been associated with the bipolar spectrum particularly among unaffected firstdegree relatives and those with milder expressions of bipolar traits This suggests a model in which large doses of risk variants cause illness but mild to moderate doses confer advantages which serve to maintain bipolar disorder in the population Bipolar disorder may thus be better conceptualized as a dimensional trait existing at the extreme of normal population variation in positive temperament personality and cognitive traits aspects of which may reflect a shared vulnerability with creativity Investigations of this shared vulnerability may provide insight into the genetic mechanisms underlying illness and suggest novel treatments
bipolar disorder,Bipolar disorder is a severe psychiatric disorder characterized by depressive manic and mixed episodes The illness affects about of the population Bipolar I disorders affect both genders equally whereas bipolar II disorders seem to occur more frequently in women The classification of the different subtypes of bipolar disorders is done depending on the severity and frequency of the episodes Other subtypes beside bipolar I and bipolar II disorder are rapid cycling more than episodes of mania depression hypomania or mixed state in one year and cyclothymia hypomanic and subdepressive symptoms over a two year period Besides a thorough psychiatric and neurological examination further clinical tests should be performed in order to exclude differential diagnosis psychiatric as well as neurological and somatic diseases The course of the illness is often negatively affected by the high frequency of psychiatric and somatic comorbidities After all the prognosis of bipolar disorder is depending on

bipolar disorder,Research aimed at elucidating the underlying neurobiology and genetics of bipolar disorder and factors associated with treatment response have been limited by a heterogeneous clinical phenotype and lack of knowledge about its underlying diathesis We used a survey of clinical epidemiological neurobiological and genetic studies to select and evaluate candidate endophenotypes for bipolar disorder Numerous findings regarding brain function brain structure and response to pharmacological challenge in bipolar patients and their relatives deserve further investigation Candidate brain function endophenotypes include attention deficits deficits in verbal learning and memory cognitive deficits after tryptophan depletion circadian rhythm instability and dysmodulation of motivation and reward We selected reduced anterior cingulate volume and earlyonset white matter abnormalities as candidate brain structure endophenotypes Symptom provocation endophenotypes might be based on bipolar patients sensitivity to sleep deprivation psychostimulants and cholinergic drugs Phenotypic heterogeneity is a major impediment to the elucidation of the neurobiology and genetics of
bipolar disorder,IntroductionThe diagnostic boundaries between schizophrenia and bipolar disorder are controversial due to the ambiguity of psychiatric nosology From this perspective it is noteworthy that formal thought disorder has historically been considered pathognomonic of schizophrenia Given that human thought is partially based on language we can hypothesize that alterations in language may help differentiate between schizophrenia and bipolar disorderMethodIn this exploratory study we employed natural language processing techniques to identify differences in language abnormalities between patients with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder The KoBERT and KoGPT language models were used to determine sentence acceptability assessing how natural and therefore acceptable a given sentence is to the general population In addition semantic word networks were constructed for each group and network measures were comparedResultsPatients with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder used less acceptable sentences than controlsPost hocanalysis revealed that the schizophrenia group used less acceptable sentences than the bipolar disorder group Furthermore the semantic
bipolar disorder,Patients may present with manic symptoms in medical settings such as emergency rooms and on inpatient medical floors leading to psychiatric consultation to try to determine the etiology of the symptoms It is crucial to clarify whether the mania is secondary to a medical illness or whether the patients symptoms are from a primary bipolar disorder In this issue we publish case reports of patients presenting with manic symptoms in medical settings The first case involves polymicrogyria in the frontal lobe of the brain as a cause of secondary mania The second case involves a patient who was previously diagnosed with bipolar disorder and subsequently developed symptoms of Behets disease In this case it appears likely that the bipolar disorder was primary and that the Behet disease and the bipolar disorder may have exacerbated each other Given the complexities involved in assessing and treating patients especially in acute or emergency

bipolar disorder,Juvenile mania is a concept widely developed but also highly debated since the 1990s In the heart of this debate Severe Mood Dysregulation SMD and Temper Dysregulation disorder with Dysphoria recently integrated in DSM showed their interest Actually the objective is to distinguish two clinical phenotypes in order to avoid confusion between what would raise more of mood dysregulation with chronic manic like symptoms and bipolar disorder type I with episodic and acute manic episodes Therapeutic stakes are major In adolescents even if DSM adult diagnostic criteria can be used and bipolar disorder type I clearly established differential diagnostic at onset between acute manic episode and schizophrenia onset remain sometimes difficult to assess Furthermore it is crucial to better assess outcome of these adolescents in terms of morbidity and potential prognosis factors knowing that a younger age at onset is associated with a poorer outcome according to several adult studies
bipolar disorder,BackgroundWhether or not unipolar mania is a separate nosological entity remains a subject of dispute This review discusses that question in light of recent dataMethodsUnipolar mania studies in the PUBMED database and relevant publications and crossreferences were searchedResultsThere seems to be a bipolar subgroup with a stable unipolar recurrent manic course and that of bipolar patients may be unipolar manic Unipolar mania may be more common in females It seems to have a slightly earlier age of illness onset more grandiosity psychotic symptoms hyperthymic temperament but less rapidcycling suicidality and comorbid anxiety disorders It seems to have a better course of illness with better social and professional adjustment However its response to lithium prophylaxis seems to be worse although its response to valproate is the same when compared to that of classical bipolarLimitationsThe few studies on the subject are mainly retrospective and the primary methodological criticism is the uncertainty of
bipolar disorder,Descriptive studies from the prelithium era and lithium prophylactic studies were reviewed to look for evidence that there are manicprone and depressiveprone subtypes of bipolar illness The manicprone subtype has a high ratio of manic to depressive episodes and a depressiveprone subtype has the reverse Although data from the prelithium era are suggestive the evidence is insufficient to accept or reject the relevance of this hypothesis Data from the lithium era suggest that there is a relationship between the type of index episode and future episode on placebo as well as drug The clinical and heuristic implications of the relationship of index to subsequent episode and manic proneness and depressive proneness are discussed Its relevance for planning prophylactic drug studies is also examined The suggestive evidence presented here will hopefully encourage other investigators to collect the data necessary to test the possibility that manicprone and depressiveprone subtypes of bipolar illness

bipolar disorder,Although bipolar disorder is increasingly recognised as a spectrum of multisystem disorders ie bipolar disorders proposed staging models and theories of bipolar disease progression often fail to incorporate longitudinal data or data from multiple domains of dysfunction We propose that bipolar disorders are best thought of as syndromes with different trajectories of development and progression for various symptoms and demographic groups This inherent complexity might be better suited to nontraditional modelling techniques potentially derived from chaos theory In this Personal View we propose an allostatic load framework to account for biomarkers of physiological symptom progression We then suggest integration of two potential domains of biobehavioural markers sleep and wake and circadian rhythm regulation and the behavioural activation system A satisfactory model should account for the effects of developmental stage as well as demographic characteristics including but not limited to sex culture ethnicity and socioeconomic status The ultimate goal of a
bipolar disorder,The concept of staging as a description of clinical advancement of illness is prevalent and commonly used in medicine Regarding bipolar mood disorder BD a staging model assumes a progression from prodromal atrisk to more severe and treatmentrefractory conditions Four different staging models of BD have been proposed The concept of Robert Posts is based on the phenomenon of kindling and neurosensitization assuming a role of stressors in triggering the first episode of illness with subsequent persistent changes in the activity of neurones greater vulnerability to relapse and worse response to treatment The concept of Anne Duffys is based on the research of high risk bipolar offspring and describes the early development of the illness as successive stages ie nonmood disorders minor mood disorders and acute episodes of illness starting in childhood with an attempt to distinguish subtypes of the disease depending on the parents response to prophylactic lithium treatment

bipolar disorder,Research aimed at elucidating the underlying neurobiology and genetics of bipolar disorder and factors associated with treatment response have been limited by a heterogeneous clinical phenotype and lack of knowledge about its underlying diathesis We used a survey of clinical epidemiological neurobiological and genetic studies to select and evaluate candidate endophenotypes for bipolar disorder Numerous findings regarding brain function brain structure and response to pharmacological challenge in bipolar patients and their relatives deserve further investigation Candidate brain function endophenotypes include attention deficits deficits in verbal learning and memory cognitive deficits after tryptophan depletion circadian rhythm instability and dysmodulation of motivation and reward We selected reduced anterior cingulate volume and earlyonset white matter abnormalities as candidate brain structure endophenotypes Symptom provocation endophenotypes might be based on bipolar patients sensitivity to sleep deprivation psychostimulants and cholinergic drugs Phenotypic heterogeneity is a major impediment to the elucidation of the neurobiology and genetics of
bipolar disorder,IntroductionThe diagnostic boundaries between schizophrenia and bipolar disorder are controversial due to the ambiguity of psychiatric nosology From this perspective it is noteworthy that formal thought disorder has historically been considered pathognomonic of schizophrenia Given that human thought is partially based on language we can hypothesize that alterations in language may help differentiate between schizophrenia and bipolar disorderMethodIn this exploratory study we employed natural language processing techniques to identify differences in language abnormalities between patients with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder The KoBERT and KoGPT language models were used to determine sentence acceptability assessing how natural and therefore acceptable a given sentence is to the general population In addition semantic word networks were constructed for each group and network measures were comparedResultsPatients with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder used less acceptable sentences than controlsPost hocanalysis revealed that the schizophrenia group used less acceptable sentences than the bipolar disorder group Furthermore the semantic
bipolar disorder,Patients may present with manic symptoms in medical settings such as emergency rooms and on inpatient medical floors leading to psychiatric consultation to try to determine the etiology of the symptoms It is crucial to clarify whether the mania is secondary to a medical illness or whether the patients symptoms are from a primary bipolar disorder In this issue we publish case reports of patients presenting with manic symptoms in medical settings The first case involves polymicrogyria in the frontal lobe of the brain as a cause of secondary mania The second case involves a patient who was previously diagnosed with bipolar disorder and subsequently developed symptoms of Behets disease In this case it appears likely that the bipolar disorder was primary and that the Behet disease and the bipolar disorder may have exacerbated each other Given the complexities involved in assessing and treating patients especially in acute or emergency

bipolar disorder,Juvenile mania is a concept widely developed but also highly debated since the 1990s In the heart of this debate Severe Mood Dysregulation SMD and Temper Dysregulation disorder with Dysphoria recently integrated in DSM showed their interest Actually the objective is to distinguish two clinical phenotypes in order to avoid confusion between what would raise more of mood dysregulation with chronic manic like symptoms and bipolar disorder type I with episodic and acute manic episodes Therapeutic stakes are major In adolescents even if DSM adult diagnostic criteria can be used and bipolar disorder type I clearly established differential diagnostic at onset between acute manic episode and schizophrenia onset remain sometimes difficult to assess Furthermore it is crucial to better assess outcome of these adolescents in terms of morbidity and potential prognosis factors knowing that a younger age at onset is associated with a poorer outcome according to several adult studies
bipolar disorder,BackgroundWhether or not unipolar mania is a separate nosological entity remains a subject of dispute This review discusses that question in light of recent dataMethodsUnipolar mania studies in the PUBMED database and relevant publications and crossreferences were searchedResultsThere seems to be a bipolar subgroup with a stable unipolar recurrent manic course and that of bipolar patients may be unipolar manic Unipolar mania may be more common in females It seems to have a slightly earlier age of illness onset more grandiosity psychotic symptoms hyperthymic temperament but less rapidcycling suicidality and comorbid anxiety disorders It seems to have a better course of illness with better social and professional adjustment However its response to lithium prophylaxis seems to be worse although its response to valproate is the same when compared to that of classical bipolarLimitationsThe few studies on the subject are mainly retrospective and the primary methodological criticism is the uncertainty of
bipolar disorder,Descriptive studies from the prelithium era and lithium prophylactic studies were reviewed to look for evidence that there are manicprone and depressiveprone subtypes of bipolar illness The manicprone subtype has a high ratio of manic to depressive episodes and a depressiveprone subtype has the reverse Although data from the prelithium era are suggestive the evidence is insufficient to accept or reject the relevance of this hypothesis Data from the lithium era suggest that there is a relationship between the type of index episode and future episode on placebo as well as drug The clinical and heuristic implications of the relationship of index to subsequent episode and manic proneness and depressive proneness are discussed Its relevance for planning prophylactic drug studies is also examined The suggestive evidence presented here will hopefully encourage other investigators to collect the data necessary to test the possibility that manicprone and depressiveprone subtypes of bipolar illness

bipolar disorder,ObjectiveThe manic spectrum is thought to be characterized by a hypersensitive biobehavioral reward system the behavioral activation system Evidence for this framework comes from questionnairebased selfreport data collected in crosssectional and prospective studies of mania mania in remission and proneness to hypomania and from functional neuroimaging investigations of brain reward circuit activity during incentivized choice protocols Although heightened reward anticipation is consistently documented the status of later goal attainment activity hedonic responses and satiety reactions is less clear This report examines the status of such reward receipt processes as they operate in the manic spectrumMethodsA case report of a typical subject with bipolar II disorder with a hyperthymic temperament is presented using longitudinal biographical dataResultsDiminished reward receipt pleasure and satiety were demonstrated indicating impaired hedonic processing in hyperthymic temperament This impairment indicates a dissociation between early intensified reward pursuit processes and later blunted reward attainment activityConclusionsThe experience and neural correlates
bipolar disorder,BackgroundEpisode duration recurrence rates and time spent in manic and depressive phases of bipolar disorder BD is not well defined for subtypes of the disorderMethodsWe reviewed the course timing and duration of episodes of mania and depression among clinically treated DSMIVTR BD patients of various types and compared duration and rates as well as total proportion of time in depressive versus manic episodes during average years at riskResultsAs expected episodes of depressions were much longer than manias but episodeduration did not differ among BD diagnostic types I II with mainly mixedepisodes BDMx or with psychotic features BDP Recurrence rates episodesyear and proportion of time in depression and their ratios to mania were highest in BDII and BDMx subjects with more maniasyear in psychotic and BDI subjects In most BDsubtypes except with psychotic features there was more time in depressive than manic morbidity owing mainly to longer depressive than manic episodes
bipolar disorder,AimsThis article examines the ongoing debate concerning the diagnosis of bipolar disorder in children and adolescents This contentious issue has generated robust discussion over the past two decades without consensus and as such the true prevalence of socalled paediatric bipolar disorder PBD remains unknown In this article we offer a solution to break this deadlockMethodsRecent metaanalyses and additional literature concerning the definition and prevalence of PBD was critically reviewed with a view to understanding the perspectives of those developing the taxonomy of PBD and those engaged in research and clinical practiceResultsA key finding is the lack of iteration and meaningful communication between the various groups interested in PBD that stems from deepseated problems within our classificatory systems This undermines our research efforts and complicates clinical practice These problems make the already difficult diagnosis of bipolar disorder in adults even more challenging to transpose to younger populations and additional complexities arise

bipolar disorder,ObjectivesPaediatric bipolar disorder bipolar disorder occurring in prepubertal children is a diagnosis subject to considerable controversy Whilst historically considered to be very rare proponents since the 1990s have argued that mania can present differently in children and as such is much more common than previously thought Such proposals raise questions about the validity of proposed phenotypes and potential risks of iatrogenic harmMethodsI critically examine the construct of paediatric bipolar disorder using Robins and Guzes 1970American Journal of Psychiatry126 influential criteria for the validity of a psychiatric diagnosis I review in turn evidence relating to its clinical description delimitation from other conditions followup studies family studies laboratory studies and treatment responseResultsAcross domains existing research highlights significant challenges establishing the diagnosis This includes significant heterogeneity in operationalising criteria for children variable or poor interrater reliability difficulty distinguishing paediatric bipolar disorder from other conditions large differences in rates of diagnosis between the United
bipolar disorder,People with bipolar disorder frequently experience persistent residual symptoms problems in psychosocial functioning cognitive impairment and poor quality of life In the last decade the treatment target in clinical and research settings has focused not only on clinical remission but also on functional recovery and more lately in personal recovery taking into account patients wellbeing and quality of life Hence the trend in psychiatry and psychology is to treat bipolar disorder in an integrative and holistic manner This literature review offers an overview regarding psychosocial functioning in bipolar disorder First a brief summary is provided regarding the definition of psychosocial functioning and the tools to measure it Then the most reported variables influencing the functional outcome in patients with bipolar disorder are listed Thereafter we include a section discussing therapies with proven efficacy at enhancing functional outcomes Other possible therapies that could be useful to prevent functional decline and improve
bipolar disorder,Bipolar disorder BPD is a potentially lifelong condition characterised by extreme changes in mood that may begin in childhood and cause substantial impairment Over the past decades BPD has been the focus of increased attention mainly due to controversies surrounding its prevalence diagnosis and treatment in children and adolescents This report addresses these controversies by reviewing the extant evidence base providing clinicians with a summary of the literature on diagnosis phenomenology and treatment of paediatric BPD The debate regarding diagnosing children with BPD based on severe irritability and aggression is mostly resolved The current data support utilising the diagnostic criteria based on episodic changes of mood polarity Therefore longitudinal course of illness should be explored in detail when diagnosing BPD Given high rates of genetic predisposition for BPD assessment of youth should focus on obtaining accurate family history of this condition Additionally there has been a substantial increase in randomised
bipolar disorder,Bipolar disorder is a lifelong mood disorder characterized by extreme mood swings between mania and depression Despite fitness costs associated with increased mortality and significant impairment bipolar disorder has persisted in the population with a high heritability and a stable prevalence Creativity and other positive traits have repeatedly been associated with the bipolar spectrum particularly among unaffected firstdegree relatives and those with milder expressions of bipolar traits This suggests a model in which large doses of risk variants cause illness but mild to moderate doses confer advantages which serve to maintain bipolar disorder in the population Bipolar disorder may thus be better conceptualized as a dimensional trait existing at the extreme of normal population variation in positive temperament personality and cognitive traits aspects of which may reflect a shared vulnerability with creativity Investigations of this shared vulnerability may provide insight into the genetic mechanisms underlying illness and suggest novel treatments
bipolar disorder,Bipolar disorder is a severe psychiatric disorder characterized by depressive manic and mixed episodes The illness affects about of the population Bipolar I disorders affect both genders equally whereas bipolar II disorders seem to occur more frequently in women The classification of the different subtypes of bipolar disorders is done depending on the severity and frequency of the episodes Other subtypes beside bipolar I and bipolar II disorder are rapid cycling more than episodes of mania depression hypomania or mixed state in one year and cyclothymia hypomanic and subdepressive symptoms over a two year period Besides a thorough psychiatric and neurological examination further clinical tests should be performed in order to exclude differential diagnosis psychiatric as well as neurological and somatic diseases The course of the illness is often negatively affected by the high frequency of psychiatric and somatic comorbidities After all the prognosis of bipolar disorder is depending on

bipolar disorder,The term cyclothymia is being used with different meanings DSMIV and ICD define cyclothymia or cyclothymic disorder as a long lasting subeffective disorder with frequent shifts between hypomanic and subdepressive states In the tradition of Kurt Schneider cyclothymia was understood as a synonym for manicdepressive illness exclusively while different personality typologies speak of a cyclothymic typus Historically the term was first used by the German psychiatrist Ewald Hecker in The definitions of DSMIV and ICD seem to be satisfactory in respect to reliability but the nosological position of cyclothymic disorder is unclear We review results concerning clinical symptomatology comorbidity biological parameters personality including the question of creativity psycho and pharmacotherapy as well as clinical course which leave many questions open Nevertheless results in family studies support the idea that at least a fraction of cyclothymia is a mild or subclinical form of bipolar disorders Until further research which is urgently

bipolar disorder,Current diagnostic criteria define bipolar I BP I and bipolar II BP II disorders as distinct conditions differing only slightly by clinical features This review seeks to identify commonalities and differentiating features across the two subtypes and emphasize that differences in causes and treatments are likely to be highly dependent on the diagnostic criteria used to define and differentiate the two conditions We undertake a literature review of candidate clinical features that might be anticipated to vary or be shared across BP I and BP II disorders and consider the impact of DSM definition on such applied findings Studies respecting DSMIV differentiation of BP I and BP II disorders have generated relatively few differences across the conditions which may reflect definitional similarity or commonalities across the two conditions As DSM decision rules are similar to those used by DSMIV to differentiate BP I and BP II disorders we argue for
bipolar disorder,Bipolar disorder is known to be highly recurrent and people with bipolar illnesses often experience high degrees of interpersonal and social impairment The emergence of prodromal symptoms not only causes distress but may also predispose patients to greater risk of a full relapse Studies have found that patients can report prodromes reliably Common mania prodromes include decreased need for sleep increased activities being more sociable and racing thoughts while common depression prodromes are loss of interest not being able to put worries aside and interrupted sleep Furthermore patients coping with prodromal symptoms predicted relapses in bipolar disorder These findings have led to a handful of randomized controlled studies which aimed at teaching patients relevant and adaptive coping strategies in dealing with bipolar prodromes as part of the intervention strategies and the results are very encouraging The packages in these studies are of different complexity The mode of intervention also varied

bipolar disorder,Although epidemiologic figures place the lifetime prevalence of bipolar disorders at about current evidence indicates that the spectrum of bipolar disorders may account for of the general population This summarizes two decades of research conducted by the author and other investigators that supports the existence of such a spectrum that at the one extreme merges with severe psychotic disorder and at the other with temperamental dysregulation The enlargement of the territory of bipolar disorders is due to new data that have validated mixed rapid cycling and soft bipolar conditions The hallmark of bipolar I disorders is mania extreme psychotic pictures often emerge when mania is mixed with depression giving rise to dysphoric mania Attenuated or soft bipolar conditions refer to major depressive episodes interspersed with milder hypomanic excursions the latter may occur spontaneously or upon pharmacologic challenge with antidepressants Bipolar II disorder is often characterized by cyclothymic intermorbid or premorbid

bipolar disorder,Purpose of reviewPrimary mania and hypomania in full or subsyndromal forms are the defining features of bipolar disorder and are common in neurologic patients as are manic syndromes precipitated by medications used to treat neurologic disorders This article addresses the diagnosis pathophysiology treatment and course of bipolar disorder after a manic episode as well as mania as a manifestation of neurologic diseaseRecent findingsMania can be a primary psychiatric disorder but can also be a symptom of a neurologic disorder especially rightsided cerebrovascular disease Treatments such as corticosteroids and dopaminergic agents for neurologic illnesses regularly induce mania The neurobiology of primary mania and bipolar disorder involves alterations in intracellular signaling changes in gene expression neural network interactions and apoptosis Except when induced by timelimited treatment with a provoking agent mania tends to be highly recurrent and to alternate or be exhibited alongside depression Symptoms of mania become more complex and treatment
bipolar disorder,Bipolar disorder BD is a chronic psychiatric illness of which the etiology remains unknown Extensive research has provided some hypotheses for the pathophysiology of this disorder however there are no molecular tests available to help support the diagnosis obtained by selfreport and behavioral observations A major requirement is to identify potential biomarkers that could be used for early diagnosis in patients susceptible to the disease and for its treatment The most recently published findings regarding alterations in BD were found to be related to oxidative stress inflammatory and trophic factor deregulation and also polymorphisms of genes that are associated with the development of BD Many of these targets are potential biomarkers which could help to identify the BD subgroups and to advance treatment strategies which would beneficiate the quality of life of these patients Therefore the main objective of this review is to examine the recent findings and critically evaluate
bipolar disorder,ObjectivesEarly intervention and preventive strategies have become major targets of research and service development in psychiatry over the last few years Compared to schizophrenia bipolar disorder BD has received limited attention in this regard In this paper we review the available literature in order to explore the public health significance of BD and the extent to which this may justify the development of early intervention strategies for this disorderMethodsThe main computerized psychiatric literature databases were accessed This included Medline and PsychInfo using the following keywords bipolar early intervention staging model burden caregiver public health and manic depressionResultsBD is often recurrent and has an impact that goes well beyond symptomatic pathology The burden it incurs is linked not only to its cardinal clinical features but also to cognitive dysfunction poor functional outcome poor physical health high rate of comorbidities and suicide At a societal level BD induces enormous direct and indirect
bipolar disorder,Growing evidence indicates that risk for bipolar disorder is characterized by elevated activation in a frontostriatal reward neural circuit involving the ventral striatum and orbitofrontal cortex among other regions It is proposed that individuals with abnormally elevated rewardrelated neural activation are at risk for experiencing an excessive increase in approachrelated motivation during life events involving rewards or goal striving and attainment In the extreme this increase in motivation is reflected in hypomanicmanic symptoms By contrast unipolar depression without a history of hypomaniamania is characterized by decreased reward responsivity and decreased rewardrelated neural activation Collectively this suggests that risk for bipolar disorder and unipolar depression are characterized by distinct and opposite profiles of reward processing and rewardrelated neural activation The objective of the present paper is threefold First we review the literature on reward processing and rewardrelated neural activation in bipolar disorder and in particular risk for hypomaniamania Second we propose

bipolar disorder,BackgroundWhether or not unipolar mania is a separate nosological entity remains a subject of dispute This review discusses that question in light of recent dataMethodsUnipolar mania studies in the PUBMED database and relevant publications and crossreferences were searchedResultsThere seems to be a bipolar subgroup with a stable unipolar recurrent manic course and that of bipolar patients may be unipolar manic Unipolar mania may be more common in females It seems to have a slightly earlier age of illness onset more grandiosity psychotic symptoms hyperthymic temperament but less rapidcycling suicidality and comorbid anxiety disorders It seems to have a better course of illness with better social and professional adjustment However its response to lithium prophylaxis seems to be worse although its response to valproate is the same when compared to that of classical bipolarLimitationsThe few studies on the subject are mainly retrospective and the primary methodological criticism is the uncertainty of
bipolar disorder,Descriptive studies from the prelithium era and lithium prophylactic studies were reviewed to look for evidence that there are manicprone and depressiveprone subtypes of bipolar illness The manicprone subtype has a high ratio of manic to depressive episodes and a depressiveprone subtype has the reverse Although data from the prelithium era are suggestive the evidence is insufficient to accept or reject the relevance of this hypothesis Data from the lithium era suggest that there is a relationship between the type of index episode and future episode on placebo as well as drug The clinical and heuristic implications of the relationship of index to subsequent episode and manic proneness and depressive proneness are discussed Its relevance for planning prophylactic drug studies is also examined The suggestive evidence presented here will hopefully encourage other investigators to collect the data necessary to test the possibility that manicprone and depressiveprone subtypes of bipolar illness
bipolar disorder,The term cyclothymia is being used with different meanings DSMIV and ICD define cyclothymia or cyclothymic disorder as a long lasting subeffective disorder with frequent shifts between hypomanic and subdepressive states In the tradition of Kurt Schneider cyclothymia was understood as a synonym for manicdepressive illness exclusively while different personality typologies speak of a cyclothymic typus Historically the term was first used by the German psychiatrist Ewald Hecker in The definitions of DSMIV and ICD seem to be satisfactory in respect to reliability but the nosological position of cyclothymic disorder is unclear We review results concerning clinical symptomatology comorbidity biological parameters personality including the question of creativity psycho and pharmacotherapy as well as clinical course which leave many questions open Nevertheless results in family studies support the idea that at least a fraction of cyclothymia is a mild or subclinical form of bipolar disorders Until further research which is urgently
bipolar disorder,The purpose of this reported study was to determine healthcare utilization and costs associated with delayed diagnosis of bipolar disorder With use of automated data from a large integrated health system in the Midwest all patients with newly diagnosed bipolar disorder recorded in any inpatient or outpatient encounter from January 2000 to August 2002 were identified The date of initial diagnosis was the index date For each patient in the bipolar cohort comparison patients were randomly selected from the general population of health system members and matched with the bipolar patients by sex race and age years Data on healthcare utilization inpatient outpatient emergency department pharmacy were collected with a focus on mental health from January 1990 through year after the index date The cohort is female and White Median time between initial mental health diagnosis and bipolar diagnosis was months with of subjects receiving a bipolar diagnosis within months
bipolar disorder,BackgroundRapid cycling defined as or more mood episodes per year is a course specifier of bipolar disorder associated with relative treatment resistance Several risk factors have been suggested to be associated with rapid cycling The purpose of this metaanalysis was to compare clinical studies for the evidence of discriminating factors between rapid and nonrapid cyclingData sources and selectionWe searched MEDLINE and reference lists of articles and book chapters and selected all of the clinical studies published from 1974 to 2002 comparing subjects with rapid and nonrapid cycling bipolar disorder Prevalence rates and mean random effect sizes for potential risk factors that were reported by at least studies were calculated In addition we differentiated between current and lifetime diagnoses of rapid cyclingData synthesisTwenty studies were identified Rapid cycling was present in of 2054 bipolar patients in studies that included patients who were consecutively admitted to an inpatient or outpatient facility without
bipolar disorder,a priori selection of rapid cyclers and without matching the numbers of rapid cyclers to nonrapid cycling controls Female gender and bipolar II subtype both had a small but statistically significant effect p for female gender p for bipolar II subtype The further absence of recurrences with lithium prophylaxis was reported in of rapid cyclers compared with of nonrapid cyclers a nearly significant difference and a partial response was present in and of patients respectively The effect of hypothyroidism was significant p in studies using current but not lifetime definitions of rapid cycling In of cases a rapid cycling course was preceded by treatment with antidepressants but systematic data on their causal role are lackingConclusionRapid cycling is slightly more prevalent in women and in patients with bipolar II subtype In contrast to common opinion lithium prophylaxis has at least partial efficacy in a considerable number of rapid cyclers especially when

bipolar disorder,Pediatric bipolar disorder once thought rare has gone through stages of conceptualization DSM criteria were reinterpreted such that children and adolescents particularly those with ADHD were commonly diagnosed with bipolar disorder and thought to be atypical by adult standards Research criteria separated pediatric bipolar patients into phenotypes including a research diagnosis of severe mood dysregulation DSM largely maintained previous criteria for bipolar disorder at all ages and created a new diagnosis called disruptive mood dysregulation disorder categorized as a depressive disorder for persistently angry or irritable patients with symptoms of childhood onset However the controversy regarding the diagnosis of pediatric bipolar disorder continues Progress has been made in the classification of children and adolescents with mood symptoms who are predominantly irritable or angry but lack of clarity remains regarding classification of children and adolescents with symptoms characteristic of bipolar disorder who do not meet criteria for bipolar I disorder bipolar
bipolar disorder,This paper seeks to raise awareness of the impact and burden of bipolar depression and the need to improve its recognition and management in clinical practice Bipolar depression is commonly misdiagnosed as unipolar depression and consequently patients may receive inappropriate treatment that could potentially worsen symptoms The Mood Disorder Questionnaire MDQ is a useful screening tool for identifying the range of bipolar spectrum disorders in general and psychiatric populations Bipolar depression has a significant impact on patients affecting work social activities family and friends Current treatments for bipolar disorder have focused on mania yet symptoms of bipolar depression occur more frequently last longer are more disruptive and are associated with greater risk of suicide than mania In comparison with unipolar depression bipolar depression is more severe is associated with more frequent hospital visits and causes greater psychosocial impairment These facts emphasise the importance of improving the diagnosis and treatment of
bipolar disorder,ObjectivesThere has been increasing interest in the depressed phase of bipolar disorder bipolar depression This paper aims to review the clinical characteristics of bipolar depression focusing upon its prevalence and phenomenology related neuropsychological dysfunction suicidal behaviour disability and treatment responsivenessMethodsStudies on the prevalence of depression in bipolar disorder the comparative phenomenology of bipolar and unipolar depression as well as neuropsychology and brain imaging studies are reviewed To identify relevant papers a literature search using MEDLINE and PubMed was undertakenResultsDepression is the predominant mood disturbance in bipolar disorder and most frequently presents as subsyndromal minor or dysthymic depression Compared with major depressive disorder unipolar depression bipolar depression is more likely to manifest with psychosis melancholic symptoms psychomotor retardation in bipolar I disorder and atypical symptoms The few neuropsychological studies undertaken indicate greater impairment in bipolar depression Suicide rates are high in bipolar disorder with suicidal ideation suicide attempts and completed suicides
bipolar disorder,Depressive phases are the most prevalent component of bipolar disorders even with modern treatment Bipolar depressive morbidity is often misdiagnosed and is limited in response to available treatments These conditions are especially debilitating and are associated with psychiatric comorbidity substance abuse functional disability and increased mortality owing to early suicide and accidents and later medical illnesses There is growing awareness that bipolar depression is one of the greatest challenges in modern psychiatry It is essential to differentiate various forms of depression dysthymia and dysphoric mixed states of bipolar disorders from the clinical features of more common unipolar major depressive disorders In bipolar depression antidepressant responses often are unsatisfactory and these agents probably are overused Emerging treatments including several anticonvulsant and modern antipsychotic drugs as well as lithiumalone or in selected combinationsare partially effective for bipolar depression Interest in recognizing bipolar depression and seeking more effective specific and safer treatments for
bipolar disorder,BackgroundEpisode duration recurrence rates and time spent in manic and depressive phases of bipolar disorder BD is not well defined for subtypes of the disorderMethodsWe reviewed the course timing and duration of episodes of mania and depression among clinically treated DSMIVTR BD patients of various types and compared duration and rates as well as total proportion of time in depressive versus manic episodes during average years at riskResultsAs expected episodes of depressions were much longer than manias but episodeduration did not differ among BD diagnostic types I II with mainly mixedepisodes BDMx or with psychotic features BDP Recurrence rates episodesyear and proportion of time in depression and their ratios to mania were highest in BDII and BDMx subjects with more maniasyear in psychotic and BDI subjects In most BDsubtypes except with psychotic features there was more time in depressive than manic morbidity owing mainly to longer depressive than manic episodes
bipolar disorder,AimsThis article examines the ongoing debate concerning the diagnosis of bipolar disorder in children and adolescents This contentious issue has generated robust discussion over the past two decades without consensus and as such the true prevalence of socalled paediatric bipolar disorder PBD remains unknown In this article we offer a solution to break this deadlockMethodsRecent metaanalyses and additional literature concerning the definition and prevalence of PBD was critically reviewed with a view to understanding the perspectives of those developing the taxonomy of PBD and those engaged in research and clinical practiceResultsA key finding is the lack of iteration and meaningful communication between the various groups interested in PBD that stems from deepseated problems within our classificatory systems This undermines our research efforts and complicates clinical practice These problems make the already difficult diagnosis of bipolar disorder in adults even more challenging to transpose to younger populations and additional complexities arise
bipolar disorder,PurposeThis review article provides an overview of the frequency burden of illness diagnosis and treatment of bipolar disorder BD from the perspective of the advanced practice nurses APNsData sourcesPubMed searches were conducted using the following keywords bipolar disorder and primary care restricted to dates 2000 to present bipolar disorder and nurse practitioner and bipolar disorder and clinical nurse specialist Selected articles were relevant to adult outpatient care in the United States with a prioritization of articles written by APNs or published in nursing journalsConclusionsBD has a substantial lifetime prevalence in the population at Because the manic or depressive symptoms of BD tend to be severe and recurrent over a patients lifetime the condition is associated with significant burden to the individual caregivers and society Clinician awareness that BD may be present increases the likelihood of successful recognition and appropriate treatment A number of pharmacological and nonpharmacological treatments are available for
bipolar disorder,ObjectivesPaediatric bipolar disorder bipolar disorder occurring in prepubertal children is a diagnosis subject to considerable controversy Whilst historically considered to be very rare proponents since the 1990s have argued that mania can present differently in children and as such is much more common than previously thought Such proposals raise questions about the validity of proposed phenotypes and potential risks of iatrogenic harmMethodsI critically examine the construct of paediatric bipolar disorder using Robins and Guzes 1970American Journal of Psychiatry126 influential criteria for the validity of a psychiatric diagnosis I review in turn evidence relating to its clinical description delimitation from other conditions followup studies family studies laboratory studies and treatment responseResultsAcross domains existing research highlights significant challenges establishing the diagnosis This includes significant heterogeneity in operationalising criteria for children variable or poor interrater reliability difficulty distinguishing paediatric bipolar disorder from other conditions large differences in rates of diagnosis between the United
bipolar disorder,People with bipolar disorder frequently experience persistent residual symptoms problems in psychosocial functioning cognitive impairment and poor quality of life In the last decade the treatment target in clinical and research settings has focused not only on clinical remission but also on functional recovery and more lately in personal recovery taking into account patients wellbeing and quality of life Hence the trend in psychiatry and psychology is to treat bipolar disorder in an integrative and holistic manner This literature review offers an overview regarding psychosocial functioning in bipolar disorder First a brief summary is provided regarding the definition of psychosocial functioning and the tools to measure it Then the most reported variables influencing the functional outcome in patients with bipolar disorder are listed Thereafter we include a section discussing therapies with proven efficacy at enhancing functional outcomes Other possible therapies that could be useful to prevent functional decline and improve
bipolar disorder,Bipolar disorder BPD is a potentially lifelong condition characterised by extreme changes in mood that may begin in childhood and cause substantial impairment Over the past decades BPD has been the focus of increased attention mainly due to controversies surrounding its prevalence diagnosis and treatment in children and adolescents This report addresses these controversies by reviewing the extant evidence base providing clinicians with a summary of the literature on diagnosis phenomenology and treatment of paediatric BPD The debate regarding diagnosing children with BPD based on severe irritability and aggression is mostly resolved The current data support utilising the diagnostic criteria based on episodic changes of mood polarity Therefore longitudinal course of illness should be explored in detail when diagnosing BPD Given high rates of genetic predisposition for BPD assessment of youth should focus on obtaining accurate family history of this condition Additionally there has been a substantial increase in randomised
bipolar disorder,Bipolar disorder is a lifelong mood disorder characterized by extreme mood swings between mania and depression Despite fitness costs associated with increased mortality and significant impairment bipolar disorder has persisted in the population with a high heritability and a stable prevalence Creativity and other positive traits have repeatedly been associated with the bipolar spectrum particularly among unaffected firstdegree relatives and those with milder expressions of bipolar traits This suggests a model in which large doses of risk variants cause illness but mild to moderate doses confer advantages which serve to maintain bipolar disorder in the population Bipolar disorder may thus be better conceptualized as a dimensional trait existing at the extreme of normal population variation in positive temperament personality and cognitive traits aspects of which may reflect a shared vulnerability with creativity Investigations of this shared vulnerability may provide insight into the genetic mechanisms underlying illness and suggest novel treatments
bipolar disorder,Bipolar disorder is a severe psychiatric disorder characterized by depressive manic and mixed episodes The illness affects about of the population Bipolar I disorders affect both genders equally whereas bipolar II disorders seem to occur more frequently in women The classification of the different subtypes of bipolar disorders is done depending on the severity and frequency of the episodes Other subtypes beside bipolar I and bipolar II disorder are rapid cycling more than episodes of mania depression hypomania or mixed state in one year and cyclothymia hypomanic and subdepressive symptoms over a two year period Besides a thorough psychiatric and neurological examination further clinical tests should be performed in order to exclude differential diagnosis psychiatric as well as neurological and somatic diseases The course of the illness is often negatively affected by the high frequency of psychiatric and somatic comorbidities After all the prognosis of bipolar disorder is depending on

bipolar disorder,ObjectivesClinical staging is widespread in medicine it informs prognosis clinical course and treatment and assists individualized care Staging places an individual on a probabilistic continuum of increasing potential disease severity ranging from clinically atrisk or latency stage through first threshold episode of illness or recurrence and finally to late or endstage disease The aim of the present paper was to examine and update the evidence regarding staging in bipolar disorder and how this might inform targeted and individualized intervention approachesMethodsWe provide a narrative review of the relevant informationResultsIn bipolar disorder the validity of staging is informed by a range of findings that accompany illness progression including neuroimaging data suggesting incremental volume loss cognitive changes and a declining likelihood of response to pharmacological and psychosocial treatments Staging informs the adoption of a number of approaches including the active promotion of both indicated prevention for atrisk individuals and early intervention strategies for
bipolar disorder,ObjectiveBipolar affective disorder runs a natural course of frequent relapses and recurrences Despite significant strides in the pharmacological treatment of bipolar disorder most bipolar patients cannot be treated only by drugs The limitations of using medication alone in symptomatic relapse prevention and satisfactionquality of life terms have long prompted interest in wider forms of management One of the promising way how to enhance remission seems to be combination of pharmacotherapy and psychoeducationMethodsStudies were identified through PUBMED Web of Science and Scopus databases as well as existing reviews The search terms included bipolar disorder psychoeducation psychotherapy psychosocial treatment family therapy individual therapy group therapy and psychoeducation The search was performed by repeated use of the words in different combinations with no language or time limitations This article is a review with conclusions concerned with psychoeducation in bipolar disorderConclusionsRandomized controlled trials of cognitive behavioral therapy interpersonal and social rhythm therapy individual group
bipolar disorder,BackgroundBipolar disorder heterogeneity is large leading to difficulties in identifying neuropathophysiological and etiological mechanisms and hindering the formation of clinically homogeneous patient groups in clinical trials Identifying markers of clinically more homogeneous groups would help disentangle BD heterogeneity Neuroimaging may aid in identifying such groups by highlighting specific biomarkers of BD subtypes or clinical dimensionsMethodsWe performed a systematic literature search of the neuroimaging literature assessing biomarkers of relevant BD phenotypes typeI vs II presence vs absence of psychotic features suicidal behavior and impulsivity rapid cycling good vs poor medication response age at onset cognitive performance and circadian abnormalitiesResultsConsistent biomarkers were associated with suicidal behavior ie frontalanterior alterations prefrontal and cingulate grey matter prefrontal white matter in patients with a history of suicide attempts and with cognitive performance ie involvement of frontal and temporal regions superior and inferior longitudinal fasciculus right thalamic radiation and corpus callosum in executive dysfunctions For the

bipolar disorder,We found evidence previously of familial aggregation of psychotic symptoms in bipolar disorder pedigrees This finding together with prior evidence from clinical family neurobiological and linkage studies suggested that psychotic bipolar disorder may delineate a valid subtype We sought to replicate this finding in new bipolar disorder pedigrees The presence of psychotic symptoms defined as hallucinations or delusions during an affective episode was compared in families of psychotic and nonpsychotic bipolar I probands ascertained at Johns Hopkins for the NIMH Bipolar Disorder Genetics Initiative There were firstdegree relatives with major affective disorder including with bipolar I disorder Significantly more psychotic proband families than nonpsychotic proband families vs contained at least one affected relative with psychotic symptoms Psychotic symptoms occurred in of relatives of psychotic probands and in of relatives of nonpsychotic probands P Both psychotic affective disorder generally and psychotic bipolar I disorder clustered significantly in families These results are
bipolar disorder,Chronobiological models have contributed to a better understanding of the pathophysiology of bipolar disorders Circadian functions dysregulations are associated with bipolar disorders including biochemical melatonin and cortisol profiles actigraphic sleepwake patterns and dimensional chronotypes circadian markers These associations are observed not only during acute episodes but also during euthymic periods Most markers that are associated with bipolar disorders are also found in the healthy relatives of patients suggesting a strong degree of heritability As such they may serve as trait markers of the disorder Several circadian genes have been found to be associated with bipolar disorders at least three studies have reported positive associations for each of CLOCK NPAS2 ARNTL1 NR1D1 PER3 RORB and CSNK1epsilon Thus the clock machinery may contribute to the genetic susceptibility to bipolar disorders The circadian model theory has also led to the development of novel therapeutic strategies such as InterPersonal and Social Rhythms Therapy and
bipolar disorder,BackgroundUsing longterm daily mood records obtained from patients with bipolar disorder and normal subjects we sought to determine the temporal pattern of mood in bipolar disorderMethodsTime series of to years from seven rapidcycling patients with bipolar disorder and normal controls were obtained These were evaluated with several techniques to identify whether the temporal pattern of mood originates from a periodic a random or a deterministic sourceResultsTrue cyclicity was not apparent in the power spectra of either the normal subjects or the patients with bipolar disorder Instead spectra with a broadband lf shape were observed in both groups and these spectra were significantly flatter in normal subjects P Correlation dimension estimates are a measure of nonlinear deterministic structure and convergent estimates could be obtained for six of the seven patients with bipolar disorder and none of the normal subjects P Additional findings are consistent with these resultsConclusionsThese studies indicate that mood
bipolar disorder,Research aimed at elucidating the underlying neurobiology and genetics of bipolar disorder and factors associated with treatment response have been limited by a heterogeneous clinical phenotype and lack of knowledge about its underlying diathesis We used a survey of clinical epidemiological neurobiological and genetic studies to select and evaluate candidate endophenotypes for bipolar disorder Numerous findings regarding brain function brain structure and response to pharmacological challenge in bipolar patients and their relatives deserve further investigation Candidate brain function endophenotypes include attention deficits deficits in verbal learning and memory cognitive deficits after tryptophan depletion circadian rhythm instability and dysmodulation of motivation and reward We selected reduced anterior cingulate volume and earlyonset white matter abnormalities as candidate brain structure endophenotypes Symptom provocation endophenotypes might be based on bipolar patients sensitivity to sleep deprivation psychostimulants and cholinergic drugs Phenotypic heterogeneity is a major impediment to the elucidation of the neurobiology and genetics of
bipolar disorder,IntroductionThe diagnostic boundaries between schizophrenia and bipolar disorder are controversial due to the ambiguity of psychiatric nosology From this perspective it is noteworthy that formal thought disorder has historically been considered pathognomonic of schizophrenia Given that human thought is partially based on language we can hypothesize that alterations in language may help differentiate between schizophrenia and bipolar disorderMethodIn this exploratory study we employed natural language processing techniques to identify differences in language abnormalities between patients with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder The KoBERT and KoGPT language models were used to determine sentence acceptability assessing how natural and therefore acceptable a given sentence is to the general population In addition semantic word networks were constructed for each group and network measures were comparedResultsPatients with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder used less acceptable sentences than controlsPost hocanalysis revealed that the schizophrenia group used less acceptable sentences than the bipolar disorder group Furthermore the semantic

anxiety disorder,Patients with generalized anxiety disorder experience worry or anxiety and a number of physical and psychologic symptoms The disorder is frequently difficult to diagnose because of the variety of presentations and the common occurrence of comorbid medical or psychiatric conditions The lifetime prevalence is approximately to percent in the general population and is more common in women than in men It is often chronic and patients with this disorder are more likely to be seen by family physicians than by psychiatrists Treatment consists of pharmacotherapy and various forms of psychotherapy The benzodiazepines are used for shortterm treatment but because of the frequently chronic nature of generalized anxiety disorder they may need to be continued for months to years Buspirone and antidepressants are also used for the pharmacologic management of patients with generalized anxiety disorder Patients must receive an appropriate pharmacologic trial with dosage titrated to optimal levels as judged by
anxiety disorder,Under the partial influences of paradigm shift form category to dimension the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorder DSM was revised to the fifth edition DSM however due to the lack of consistent biological makers and processes and the restricted availability of dimensional metastructure the revisions for the DSM were based on a combination of categorical and dimensional approaches Anxiety disorders were more clearly and consistently defined in the DSM with the removal of obsessive compulsive acute stress and posttraumatic stress disorders Differences between the childhood and adulthood categories of anxiety disorders were decreased and overall the symmetrical classification of anxiety subtypes was increased since separation anxiety disorder and selective mutism were considered anxiety disorders not neurodevelopmental disorders Additionally based on growing evidence agoraphobia is distinct from panic disorder Next considering cultural syndromes including taijin kyofusho khyal cap trung gio attacks and ataque de nervios cultural influences are considered

anxiety disorder,The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders Fifth Edition DSM categorization of mental disorders places separation anxiety disorder within the broad group of anxiety disorders and its diagnosis no longer rests on establishing an onset during childhood or adolescence In previous editions of DSM it was included within the disorders usually first diagnosed in infancy childhood or adolescence with the requirement for an onset of symptoms before the age of years symptomatic adults could only receive a retrospective diagnosis based on establishing this early onset The new position of separation anxiety disorder is based upon the findings of epidemiological studies that revealed the unexpectedly high prevalence of the condition in adults often in individuals with an onset of symptoms after the teenage years its prominent place within the DSM group of anxiety disorders should encourage further research into its epidemiology etiology and treatment This review examines the clinical features
anxiety disorder,Social anxiety disorder SAD is a highly prevalent and disabling disorder with key behavioral traits of social fearfulness social avoidance and submissiveness Here we argue that hormonal systems play a key role in mediating social anxiety and so may be important in SAD Hormonal alterations often established early in development through the interaction between biological and psychological factors eg genetic predisposition x early trauma predispose to socially fearful avoidant and submissive behavior However whereas gene variants and histories of trauma persist hormonal systems can be remodeled over the course of life Hormones play a key role during the periods of all sensitive developmental windows ie prenatal neonatal puberty aging and are capable of opening up new developmental windows in adulthood Indeed the developmental plasticity of our social brain and thus of social behavior in adulthood critically depends on steroid hormones such as testosterone and peptide hormones such as oxytocin These

anxiety disorder,The interest in the use of noninvasive brain stimulation for enhancing neural functions and reducing symptoms in anxiety disorders is growing Based on the DSMV classification for anxiety disorders we examined all available research using repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation rTMS and transcranial direct current stimulation tDCS for the treatment of specific phobias social anxiety disorder panic disorder agoraphobia and generalized anxiety disorder A systematic literature search conducted in PubMed and Google Scholar databases provided results shamcontrolled studies and not shamcontrolled studies With regard to the latter subgroup of studies were case reports and open label studies Overall our work provides preliminary evidence that both excitatory stimulation of the left prefrontal cortex and inhibitory stimulation of the right prefrontal cortex can reduce symptom severity in anxiety disorders The current results are discussed in the light of a model for the treatment for anxiety disorders via noninvasive brain stimulation which is based
anxiety disorder,BackgroundCognitive models of generalized anxiety disorder GAD suggest that maladaptive behaviours may contribute to the maintenance of the disorder however little research has concentrated on identifying and measuring these behaviours To address this gap the Worry Behaviors Inventory WBI was developed and has been evaluated within a classical test theory CTT approachAimsAs CTT is limited in several important respects this study examined the psychometric properties of the WBI using an Item Response Theory approachMethodA large sample of adults commencing treatment for their symptoms of GAD n completed the WBI in addition to measures of GAD and depression symptom severityResultsPatients with a probable diagnosis of GAD typically engaged in four or five maladaptive behaviours most or all of the time in an attempt to prevent control or avoid worrying about everyday concerns The twofactor structure of the WBI was confirmed and the WBI scales demonstrated good reliability across a broad range
anxiety disorder,BackgroundThis investigation assessed the effect of personality disorders PersDs on time to remission in patients with generalized anxiety disorder social phobia or panic disorderMethodsSelected Axis I and II predictors of time to remission during years of followup were assessed in patients with or more of these anxiety disorders who participated in the HarvardBrown Anxiety Research Program a multisite prospective longitudinal naturalistic studyResultsThe presence of a PersD predicted a lower likelihood of generalized anxiety disorder remission a lower likelihood of social phobia remission and no difference in likelihood of panic disorder remission More specifically a lower likelihood of remission from generalized anxiety disorder was predicted by the presence of avoidant PersD lower and dependent PersD lower The presence of avoidant PersD predicted a lower likelihood of social phobia remission The presence of major depressive disorder did not account for these findingsConclusionsOur findings provide new data on the pernicious effect of PersDs
anxiety disorder,Two hundred and fortyfour patients with various subtypes of DSMIII anxiety disorder were found among outpatients who visited our clinic consecutively for evaluation for five years They included patients with panic disorder comprising an outstanding number of patients about a quarter of patients with anxiety disorder and of the whole outpatient population and with generalized anxiety disorder Differentiation between these two groups was difficult to make besides their specific clinical features whether the patient had panic attacks or chronic generalized anxiety The patients with anxiety disorder were divided into two major groupspanicgeneralized anxietysimple phobia and social phobiaobsessive compulsiveagoraphobiain respect to their age of onset of the illness the duration of episode separation from their parents psychosocial stressors and response to pharmacotherapy Social phobia and obsessive compulsive disorder comprised those patients with similar qualities to each other in terms of their demographic data and their social backgrounds forming a distinct group

anxiety disorder,BackgroundA number of metaanalyses have led to contradictory results regarding the efficacy of the psychological and pharmacological treatment of anxiety disorders The main reasons for these inconsistent results seem to be the inclusion of heterogeneous studies and influences of selection biases We performed a metaanalysis which only included studies using a direct comparison of pharmacological psychological or combined treatmentsMethodSixteen studies on panic disorder six studies on social anxiety disorder and two studies on generalized anxiety disorder have been analyzed Effect sizes for differences between the different treatment modalities were calculated Also the effect sizes of the prepost differences were calculatedResultsPharmacological treatment cognitivebehavioural treatment and the combination of both treatment modalities all led to substantial improvement between pre and posttreatment Combined pharmacological and psychological treatment was superior to the monotherapies for panic disorder For social anxiety disorder there is only preliminary support for combined treatment Due to lack of sufficient data
anxiety disorder,Anxiety disorders have a peak age of onset in early adulthood and their prevalence and incidence decline in later life Most cases of anxiety disorder in late life are chronic having persisted from younger years Generalized anxiety and agoraphobia account for most cases of lateonset anxiety Lateonset generalized anxiety is usually associated with a depressive illness On the other hand most individuals with lateonset agoraphobia do not have comorbid depression or a history of panic attacks and the illness often starts after a traumatic event Case reports and uncontrolled trials indicate that older persons with anxiety disorders can respond to the same treatments that have been found to be efficacious in younger patients although it is unknown whether the two groups have similar rates of response The current clinical reality is that most cases of anxiety disorder in late life are undetected and when treatment is given benzodiazepines are overused

anxiety disorder,The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders Fifth Edition DSM categorization of mental disorders places separation anxiety disorder within the broad group of anxiety disorders and its diagnosis no longer rests on establishing an onset during childhood or adolescence In previous editions of DSM it was included within the disorders usually first diagnosed in infancy childhood or adolescence with the requirement for an onset of symptoms before the age of years symptomatic adults could only receive a retrospective diagnosis based on establishing this early onset The new position of separation anxiety disorder is based upon the findings of epidemiological studies that revealed the unexpectedly high prevalence of the condition in adults often in individuals with an onset of symptoms after the teenage years its prominent place within the DSM group of anxiety disorders should encourage further research into its epidemiology etiology and treatment This review examines the clinical features
anxiety disorder,Social anxiety disorder SAD is a highly prevalent and disabling disorder with key behavioral traits of social fearfulness social avoidance and submissiveness Here we argue that hormonal systems play a key role in mediating social anxiety and so may be important in SAD Hormonal alterations often established early in development through the interaction between biological and psychological factors eg genetic predisposition x early trauma predispose to socially fearful avoidant and submissive behavior However whereas gene variants and histories of trauma persist hormonal systems can be remodeled over the course of life Hormones play a key role during the periods of all sensitive developmental windows ie prenatal neonatal puberty aging and are capable of opening up new developmental windows in adulthood Indeed the developmental plasticity of our social brain and thus of social behavior in adulthood critically depends on steroid hormones such as testosterone and peptide hormones such as oxytocin These
anxiety disorder,The diagnosis of generalized anxiety disorder GAD was first introduced in 1980 with the publication of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders Third Edition DSMIII of the American Psychiatric Association Prior to this the diagnosis of anxiety neurosis was given to patients with symptoms similar to those now incorporated within the GAD category Originally GAD was created as a residual category within the anxiety disorders as a rubric for patients with serious anxiety problems but without panic attacks Panic disorder therefore received far more research attention and GAD was seen as a diagnosis of exclusion once panic disorder had been ruled out It is now clear however that GAD is a serious psychiatric disorder that is more common than panic disorder and frequently encountered in primary care practice Indeed the primary care physician is more likely to see patients with pure GAD than is the psychiatrist While the

anxiety disorder,In DSMIII DSMIIIR and DSMIV obsessivecompulsive disorder OCD was classified as an anxiety disorder In ICD OCD is classified separately from the anxiety disorders although within the same larger category as anxiety disorders as one of the neurotic stressrelated and somatoform disorders Ongoing advances in our understanding of OCD and other anxiety disorders have raised the question of whether OCD should continue to be classified with the anxiety disorders in DSMV This review presents a number of options and preliminary recommendations to be considered for DSMV Evidence is reviewed for retaining OCD in the category of anxiety disorders and for moving OCD to a separate category of obsessivecompulsive OCspectrum disorders if such a category is included in DSMV Our preliminary recommendation is that OCD be retained in the category of anxiety disorders but that this category also includes OCspectrum disorders along with OCD If this change is made the name

anxiety disorder,Epidemiological data suggest that early smoking increases the risk for emergence of certain anxiety disorders eg panic disorder generalized anxiety disorder GAD and that presence of certain anxiety disorders eg social anxiety increases the risk for later development of nicotine dependence Although some studies report a high prevalence of smoking among anxiety disorders the extent to which smokers with anxiety disorders differ from their nonsmoking counterparts remains uncertain Differences between smokers and nonsmokers with anxiety disorders N were examined with respect to multiple measures of theoretical and clinical interest Compared to nonsmokers smokers with anxiety disorders reported greater anxiety sensitivity anxiety symptoms agoraphobic avoidance depressed mood negative affect stress and life interference however these differences were largely accounted for by panic disorder No differences were found between smokers and nonsmokers regarding social anxiety worry obsessivecompulsive symptoms or positive affect Differential patterns were observed when evaluating constructs within anxiety disorder diagnoses
anxiety disorder,The paper describes symptoms of mixed depressive and anxiety disorder ICD The study was carried out in three medical dispensaries two psychiatric persons and one primary care persons Patients with or without anxiety and depressive symptoms were included Exclusion criteria was psychoactive substance abuse physical diseases affecting mental state and mental disorders other than anxiety or mood disorders A total of patients women and men in mean age of years were inquired with General Health Questionnaire GHQ Global Assessment of Functioning GAF and diagnostic questionnaire based on Schedules for Clinical Assessment in Neuropsychiatry Version There was no pattern of symptoms specific for mixed disorder that could be a basis for operational criteria The most frequent were symptoms of generalised anxiety disorder GAD depression and dysthymia The most specific symptoms selected using discriminant analysis were difficulty in concentrating feeling mentally tense feeling of hopelessness or despair shortening of breath lowered mood
anxiety disorder,BackgroundA number of metaanalyses have led to contradictory results regarding the efficacy of the psychological and pharmacological treatment of anxiety disorders The main reasons for these inconsistent results seem to be the inclusion of heterogeneous studies and influences of selection biases We performed a metaanalysis which only included studies using a direct comparison of pharmacological psychological or combined treatmentsMethodSixteen studies on panic disorder six studies on social anxiety disorder and two studies on generalized anxiety disorder have been analyzed Effect sizes for differences between the different treatment modalities were calculated Also the effect sizes of the prepost differences were calculatedResultsPharmacological treatment cognitivebehavioural treatment and the combination of both treatment modalities all led to substantial improvement between pre and posttreatment Combined pharmacological and psychological treatment was superior to the monotherapies for panic disorder For social anxiety disorder there is only preliminary support for combined treatment Due to lack of sufficient data
anxiety disorder,Anxiety disorders have a peak age of onset in early adulthood and their prevalence and incidence decline in later life Most cases of anxiety disorder in late life are chronic having persisted from younger years Generalized anxiety and agoraphobia account for most cases of lateonset anxiety Lateonset generalized anxiety is usually associated with a depressive illness On the other hand most individuals with lateonset agoraphobia do not have comorbid depression or a history of panic attacks and the illness often starts after a traumatic event Case reports and uncontrolled trials indicate that older persons with anxiety disorders can respond to the same treatments that have been found to be efficacious in younger patients although it is unknown whether the two groups have similar rates of response The current clinical reality is that most cases of anxiety disorder in late life are undetected and when treatment is given benzodiazepines are overused
anxiety disorder,ObjectiveMajor depression occurs with generalized anxiety disorder and panic disorder in up to of psychiatric and primary care patients This comorbidity has been associated with greater severity of depression poorer psychosocial functioning and poorer treatment outcomes in psychiatric samples This study examined the clinical outcomes for depressed primary care patients with and without a lifetime anxiety disorderMethodA total of primary care patients who met criteria for major depression were randomly assigned to standardized interpersonal psychotherapy or pharmacotherapy with nortriptyline and were assessed at baseline and at and months on severity of depression psychosocial functioning and healthrelated functioningResultsDepressed patients with a comorbid anxiety disorder presented with significantly more psychopathology and tended to prematurely terminate treatment more frequently than patients with major depression alone Both standardized depressionspecific treatments were effective for depressed patients with and without a comorbid generalized anxiety disorder although time to recovery was longer for the former Patients with

anxiety disorder,Generalized anxiety disorder GAD is a prevalent and highly disabling mental health condition however there is still much to learn with regard to pertinent biomarkers as well as diagnosis made more difficult by the marked and common overlap of GAD with affective and anxiety disorders Recently intensive research efforts have focused on GAD applying neuroimaging genetic and bloodbased approaches toward discovery of pathogenetic and treatmentrelated biomarkers In this paper we review the large amount of available data and we focus in particular on evidence from neuroimaging genetic and neurochemical measurements in GAD in order to better understand potential biomarkers involved in its etiology and treatment Overall the majority of these studies have produced results that are solitary findings sometimes inconsistent and not clearly replicable For these reasons they have not yet been translated into clinical practice Therefore further research efforts are needed to distinguish GAD from other mental disorders and
anxiety disorder,Generalized anxiety disorder GAD and panic disorder PD are among the most common mental disorders in the United States and they can negatively impact a patients quality of life and disrupt important activities of daily living Evidence suggests that the rates of missed diagnoses and misdiagnosis of GAD and PD are high with symptoms often ascribed to physical causes Diagnosing GAD and PD requires a broad differential and caution to identify confounding variables and comorbid conditions Screening and monitoring tools can be used to help make the diagnosis and monitor response to therapy The GAD and the Severity Measure for Panic Disorder are free diagnostic tools Successful outcomes may require a combination of treatment modalities tailored to the individual patient Treatment often includes medications such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors andor psychotherapy both of which are highly effective Among psychotherapeutic treatments cognitive behavior therapy has been studied widely and has
anxiety disorder,Generalised anxiety disorder is a persistent and common disorder in which the patient has unfocused worry and anxiety that is not connected to recent stressful events although it can be aggravated by certain situations This disorder is twice as common in women than it is in men Generalised anxiety disorder is characterised by feelings of threat restlessness irritability sleep disturbance and tension and symptoms such as palpitations dry mouth and sweating These symptoms are recognised as part of the anxiety syndrome rather than independent complaints The symptoms overlap greatly with those of other common mental disorders and we could regard the disorder as part of a spectrum of mood and related disorders rather than an independent disorder Generalised anxiety disorder has a relapsing course and intervention rarely results in complete resolution of symptoms but in the short term and medium term effective treatments include psychological therapies such as cognitive behavioural

anxiety disorder,Generalized Anxiety Disorder GAD from an official recognition as a residual category in DSMIII has come a long way to be appreciated as a common underlying anxiety pathway in the literature Despite still being defined as extreme anxiety and worry upon performance and about ones health GAD seems to be a general umbrella of anxiety covering even social anxiety and panic disorder PD and even when not treated and chronic leading to major depressive disorder MDD Along the line of some other similar studies and contentions in the present study we sought to validate the hypothesis of GAD encompassing social anxiety as well as performance anxiety and its extension to PD and MDD We also examined the onset of each diagnostic category of GAD PD and MDD and their developmental course in our clinical sample patients with Generalized Anxiety Disorder GAD out of referrals to our mood and anxiety clinic
anxiety disorder,during the three months of MayJuly 2019 were identified and included in this research We expanded the definition of GAD as per our clinical observation to include any situations triggering the anxiety including any performance and social situations and did not exclude if the anxiety led to panic attacks The results of our study showed that an encompassing GAD including performance and social anxiety has an early onset recognized partially in childhood but mostly during adolescence An untreated GAD was complicated with panic disorder and episodes of major depression each with an onset later in life GAD in our study was also found to be familial and genetic while its postmorbid depression seemed to be more a reaction to a longstanding untreated anxiety The findings of our study if replicated has research implication of better understanding the developmental course of mood disorders and hold the promise of more targeted treatments

anxiety disorder,ObjectivesDue to the cooccurrence of symptoms of anxiety disorders and obsessivecompulsive disorders and the hypothesis about common etiopathological factors we performed a research addressing the occurrence and severity of anxiety symptoms the severity of groups of neurotic symptoms and conducted factor analyses in two groups of patients diagnosed with obsessive compulsive disorder OCD and with generalized anxiety disorder GADMaterial and methodsA retrospective study was conducted on two groups of patients diagnosed with OCD and diagnosed with GAD The source of information about the presence and severity of symptoms was the Symptom Checklist O KOO The impact of sex and the presence or absence of cognitive impairments Benders and Bentons tests on the investigated associations were accounted forResultsNo significant differences in the severity of most anxiety symptoms were found between the groups of patients diagnosed with OCD or GAD Patients with GAD were characterized by a significantly higher intensity of phobic
anxiety disorder,BackgroundThere is a lack of clarity regarding specific risk factors discriminating generalized anxiety disorder GAD from panic disorder PDGoalThis study investigated whether GAD and PD could be discriminated through differences in developmental etiological factors including childhood parental lossseparation psychological disorders and maternal and paternal attachmentMethodTwenty people with adult generalized anxiety disorder GAD with adult panic disorder PD with adult comorbid GAD and PD and adult nonanxious controls completed diagnostic interviews to assess symptoms of mental disorders in adulthood and childhood Participants also reported on parental attachment loss and separationResultsChildhood diagnoses of GAD and PD differentiated clinical groups from controls as well as from each other suggesting greater likelihood for homotypic over heterotypic continuity Compared to controls specific phobia was associated with all three clinical groups and childhood depression social phobia and PTSD were uniquely associated with adult GAD Both maternal and paternal attachment also differentiated clinical groups from controls However

anxiety disorder,The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders Fifth Edition DSM categorization of mental disorders places separation anxiety disorder within the broad group of anxiety disorders and its diagnosis no longer rests on establishing an onset during childhood or adolescence In previous editions of DSM it was included within the disorders usually first diagnosed in infancy childhood or adolescence with the requirement for an onset of symptoms before the age of years symptomatic adults could only receive a retrospective diagnosis based on establishing this early onset The new position of separation anxiety disorder is based upon the findings of epidemiological studies that revealed the unexpectedly high prevalence of the condition in adults often in individuals with an onset of symptoms after the teenage years its prominent place within the DSM group of anxiety disorders should encourage further research into its epidemiology etiology and treatment This review examines the clinical features
anxiety disorder,Social anxiety disorder SAD is a highly prevalent and disabling disorder with key behavioral traits of social fearfulness social avoidance and submissiveness Here we argue that hormonal systems play a key role in mediating social anxiety and so may be important in SAD Hormonal alterations often established early in development through the interaction between biological and psychological factors eg genetic predisposition x early trauma predispose to socially fearful avoidant and submissive behavior However whereas gene variants and histories of trauma persist hormonal systems can be remodeled over the course of life Hormones play a key role during the periods of all sensitive developmental windows ie prenatal neonatal puberty aging and are capable of opening up new developmental windows in adulthood Indeed the developmental plasticity of our social brain and thus of social behavior in adulthood critically depends on steroid hormones such as testosterone and peptide hormones such as oxytocin These

anxiety disorder,BackgroundCognitive models of generalized anxiety disorder GAD suggest that maladaptive behaviours may contribute to the maintenance of the disorder however little research has concentrated on identifying and measuring these behaviours To address this gap the Worry Behaviors Inventory WBI was developed and has been evaluated within a classical test theory CTT approachAimsAs CTT is limited in several important respects this study examined the psychometric properties of the WBI using an Item Response Theory approachMethodA large sample of adults commencing treatment for their symptoms of GAD n completed the WBI in addition to measures of GAD and depression symptom severityResultsPatients with a probable diagnosis of GAD typically engaged in four or five maladaptive behaviours most or all of the time in an attempt to prevent control or avoid worrying about everyday concerns The twofactor structure of the WBI was confirmed and the WBI scales demonstrated good reliability across a broad range

anxiety disorder,The study investigates whether a putative diagnosis of separation anxiety disorder can be identified in adulthood and whether there are continuities between juvenile and adult forms of the disorder Seventy patients with conventional adult diagnoses of panic disorder and generalized anxiety disorder attending an anxiety clinic were administered an interview and checklist to assess separation anxiety SA symptoms in adulthood Memories of early SA were assessed using the Separation Anxiety Symptom Inventory SASI A subsample n was used to calibrate the checklist against assignment to a category of adult separation anxiety disorder ASAD based on the structured interview In an expanded sample n patients assigned to the ASAD category returned statistically higher scores on the SASI with the severity of juvenile SA symptoms accounting for of the variance of adult SA scores p Assignment of subjects to the putative ASAD category was not associated with any conventional adult anxiety diagnosis
anxiety disorder,With the advent of DSMIIIR the diagnostic criteria for generalized anxiety disorder GAD shifted in emphasis from the autonomic arousal to the cognitive component of the disorder namely worry The Penn State Worry Questionnaire was developed to assess the trait of worry and has proven to be a reliable and valid measure in a series of studies largely based on college student samples The purpose of the present study was to assess the psychometric properties and utility of the PSWQ in a clinical sample of anxiety disorder patients and normal controls Factor analysis indicated that the PSWQ assesses a unidimensional construct Furthermore the PSWQ evidenced quite favorable internal consistency using GAD patients and each of the other anxiety disorder groups and normal controls The validity of the PSWQ was supported by an analysis indicating that the measure distinguished GADs from each of the other anxiety disorder groups including those with

anxiety disorder,BackgroundA number of metaanalyses have led to contradictory results regarding the efficacy of the psychological and pharmacological treatment of anxiety disorders The main reasons for these inconsistent results seem to be the inclusion of heterogeneous studies and influences of selection biases We performed a metaanalysis which only included studies using a direct comparison of pharmacological psychological or combined treatmentsMethodSixteen studies on panic disorder six studies on social anxiety disorder and two studies on generalized anxiety disorder have been analyzed Effect sizes for differences between the different treatment modalities were calculated Also the effect sizes of the prepost differences were calculatedResultsPharmacological treatment cognitivebehavioural treatment and the combination of both treatment modalities all led to substantial improvement between pre and posttreatment Combined pharmacological and psychological treatment was superior to the monotherapies for panic disorder For social anxiety disorder there is only preliminary support for combined treatment Due to lack of sufficient data
anxiety disorder,Anxiety disorders have a peak age of onset in early adulthood and their prevalence and incidence decline in later life Most cases of anxiety disorder in late life are chronic having persisted from younger years Generalized anxiety and agoraphobia account for most cases of lateonset anxiety Lateonset generalized anxiety is usually associated with a depressive illness On the other hand most individuals with lateonset agoraphobia do not have comorbid depression or a history of panic attacks and the illness often starts after a traumatic event Case reports and uncontrolled trials indicate that older persons with anxiety disorders can respond to the same treatments that have been found to be efficacious in younger patients although it is unknown whether the two groups have similar rates of response The current clinical reality is that most cases of anxiety disorder in late life are undetected and when treatment is given benzodiazepines are overused
anxiety disorder,ObjectiveMajor depression occurs with generalized anxiety disorder and panic disorder in up to of psychiatric and primary care patients This comorbidity has been associated with greater severity of depression poorer psychosocial functioning and poorer treatment outcomes in psychiatric samples This study examined the clinical outcomes for depressed primary care patients with and without a lifetime anxiety disorderMethodA total of primary care patients who met criteria for major depression were randomly assigned to standardized interpersonal psychotherapy or pharmacotherapy with nortriptyline and were assessed at baseline and at and months on severity of depression psychosocial functioning and healthrelated functioningResultsDepressed patients with a comorbid anxiety disorder presented with significantly more psychopathology and tended to prematurely terminate treatment more frequently than patients with major depression alone Both standardized depressionspecific treatments were effective for depressed patients with and without a comorbid generalized anxiety disorder although time to recovery was longer for the former Patients with

anxiety disorder,The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders Fifth Edition DSM categorization of mental disorders places separation anxiety disorder within the broad group of anxiety disorders and its diagnosis no longer rests on establishing an onset during childhood or adolescence In previous editions of DSM it was included within the disorders usually first diagnosed in infancy childhood or adolescence with the requirement for an onset of symptoms before the age of years symptomatic adults could only receive a retrospective diagnosis based on establishing this early onset The new position of separation anxiety disorder is based upon the findings of epidemiological studies that revealed the unexpectedly high prevalence of the condition in adults often in individuals with an onset of symptoms after the teenage years its prominent place within the DSM group of anxiety disorders should encourage further research into its epidemiology etiology and treatment This review examines the clinical features
anxiety disorder,Social anxiety disorder SAD is a highly prevalent and disabling disorder with key behavioral traits of social fearfulness social avoidance and submissiveness Here we argue that hormonal systems play a key role in mediating social anxiety and so may be important in SAD Hormonal alterations often established early in development through the interaction between biological and psychological factors eg genetic predisposition x early trauma predispose to socially fearful avoidant and submissive behavior However whereas gene variants and histories of trauma persist hormonal systems can be remodeled over the course of life Hormones play a key role during the periods of all sensitive developmental windows ie prenatal neonatal puberty aging and are capable of opening up new developmental windows in adulthood Indeed the developmental plasticity of our social brain and thus of social behavior in adulthood critically depends on steroid hormones such as testosterone and peptide hormones such as oxytocin These

post-traumatic stress disorder,PostTraumatic Stress Disorder PTSD is a disorder that develops following the experience of a highly stressful event which involves a confrontation with death or the threat of death serious injury or sexual violence It is characterized by symptoms such as intrusions avoidance and hypervigilance According to the literature PTSD is associated with an imbalance between a privileged memorization of the emotional and sensory aspects of the traumatic event and a failure to memorize the contextual aspects That is why PTSD is now considered a memory disorder whose effects extend to several components In this review article we focus on how PTSD affects longterm memory The first part describes the longterm effects of PTSD on episodic memory with emphasis on the difficulties in encoding certain elements of the traumatic event and their consequences These difficulties may be manifested in the narration of the trauma with a discourse of the traumatic event
post-traumatic stress disorder,lacking in contextual details They may also lead to reliving and generalizing the fear to other contexts whether they are related to the trauma or not The second part of the article discusses how PTSD affects autobiographical memory and has consequences for the construction of identity and the perception of the past present and future of people with this disorder Autobiographical memory which plays a key role in the storage of past personal memories as well as in identity formation shows several forms of disruption induced by PTSD First a decrease in contextual details associated with memories of the personal past is observed meaning that people with PTSD tend to remember their past experiences less accurately Second a propensity to project the future in a more negative and unpredictable manner is evidenced related to a feeling of uncertainty about the future in PTSD suffering individuals Finally alterations in the encoding

post-traumatic stress disorder,While posttraumatic stress disorder PTSD is currently diagnosed based solely on classic psychological and behavioral symptoms a growing body of evidence has highlighted a link between this disorder and alterations in the immune and inflammatory systems Epidemiological studies have demonstrated that PTSD is associated with significantly increased rates of physical comorbidities in which immune dysregulation is involved such as metabolic syndrome atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and autoimmune diseases In line with this a number of blood biomarker studies have reported that compared to healthy controls individuals with PTSD exhibit significantly elevated levels of proinflammatory markers such as interleukin1 interleukin tumor necrosis factor and Creactive protein Moreover various lines of animal and human research have suggested that inflammation is not only associated with PTSD but also can play an important role in its pathogenesis and pathophysiology In this review we first summarize evidence suggestive of increased inflammation in PTSD We then examine
post-traumatic stress disorder,ObjectiveThe review aimed to summarize the existing knowledge base regarding posttraumatic stress disorder after severe traumatic brain injury TBI and try to guide future researchMethodWeb of Science Scopus and PubMed databases were used to identify original studies that explored the relationship between severe TBI and posttraumatic stress disorderResultsA total of studies were included in the review They have been examined in terms of potentially compatible and incompatible mechanisms as well as of possible confounding factors in relation to the diagnosis of posttraumatic stress disorder after severe TBIConclusionOnly a few studies in the literature have addressed the present topic therefore the prevalence of posttraumatic stress disorder in patients with severe TBI still needs to be further investigated In particular future studies should be conducted only in severe TBI populations considering their premorbid personality characteristics and their reactivity alteration They should also obtain an accurate and appropriate assessment of posttraumatic stress disorder

post-traumatic stress disorder,Posttraumatic stress disorder PTSD was first introduced as a diagnosis by the American Psychiatric Association in 1980 This diagnosis included in the 3rd edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of the American Psychiatric Association DSMIII was to be considered after someone was exposed to a traumatic event outside the range of usual human experience and would be markedly distressing to almost anyone Since then trauma survivors have been identified as being at risk for the development of posttraumatic stress symptom PTSS and posttraumatic stress disorder PTSD Despite the recognition of this fact the screening recognition and diagnosis of PTSD in these atrisk populations are inconsistent In the following review which is designed for the clinician who is unfamiliar with PTSD and its recognition diagnosis and treatment we introduce the problem in the trauma patient and define its scope In addition we discuss the diagnosis of PTSD in trauma patients
post-traumatic stress disorder,PostTraumatic Stress Disorder PTSD is a disorder that develops following the experience of a highly stressful event which involves a confrontation with death or the threat of death serious injury or sexual violence It is characterized by symptoms such as intrusions avoidance and hypervigilance According to the literature PTSD is associated with an imbalance between a privileged memorization of the emotional and sensory aspects of the traumatic event and a failure to memorize the contextual aspects That is why PTSD is now considered a memory disorder whose effects extend to several components In this review article we focus on how PTSD affects longterm memory The first part describes the longterm effects of PTSD on episodic memory with emphasis on the difficulties in encoding certain elements of the traumatic event and their consequences These difficulties may be manifested in the narration of the trauma with a discourse of the traumatic event
post-traumatic stress disorder,lacking in contextual details They may also lead to reliving and generalizing the fear to other contexts whether they are related to the trauma or not The second part of the article discusses how PTSD affects autobiographical memory and has consequences for the construction of identity and the perception of the past present and future of people with this disorder Autobiographical memory which plays a key role in the storage of past personal memories as well as in identity formation shows several forms of disruption induced by PTSD First a decrease in contextual details associated with memories of the personal past is observed meaning that people with PTSD tend to remember their past experiences less accurately Second a propensity to project the future in a more negative and unpredictable manner is evidenced related to a feeling of uncertainty about the future in PTSD suffering individuals Finally alterations in the encoding
post-traumatic stress disorder,BackgroundThe update of the PostTraumatic Stress Disorder PTSD in the fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders DSM5 emphasizes the definition of psychological traumatism as an objective and external event Nevertheless the scientific debate about the criteriology of PTSD its clinical pertinence for application and the role of subjective dimension appears still open Although the relation between psychotrauma and psychosis has been well examined in the way of trauma as a risk factor for the development of schizophrenia the potential traumatism represented by the psychotic experience seems to be less knownObjectiveThis paper aims to provide a state of the art about the PTSD in reaction to psychosis defined as PTSD post psychosis PTSDPP particularly in epidemiological and psychopathological termsMethodsWe performed a bibliographic research on Pubmed using the keywords posttraumatic stress disorder psychological trauma schizophrenia review psychosis first episode psychosis recovery schizophrenia with a first screening on
post-traumatic stress disorder,titles and abstracts An acute psychotic episode referred to a decompensation of any pathology of the DSM5schizophrenia spectrum or other psychotic disorders or to a mood disorder with psychotic features The articles exclusively interested in the traumatic impact of hospitalizations and treatment conditions were excludedResultsThe literature noted that PTSDPP affected about a quarter to a third of the psychotic patients interrogated during the recovery of an acute psychotic episode The analytic epidemiology showed that the main validated risk factors for PTSD were also relevant in the development of PTSDPP including past traumatic history childhood trauma and feeling of helplessness during the traumatic event Criticizing the methodological heterogeneity through studies the observational approach brought out the lack of clinical pertinence of the DSM5A criteria defining the traumatic event for PTSD This criteriology failed to consider the subjective dimension of the threat to psychological integrity generated by a psychotrauma Historical case studies
post-traumatic stress disorder,presented a complete posttraumatic symptomatology in reaction to psychosis suggesting that the supposed psychotic residual symptoms after acute phase could referr to actual traumatic reactions The PTSDPP process observed in descriptive research and patients interviews appeared congruent with the cognitive model of PTSD elaborated by Ehlers and Clark Indeed psychotic patients developed negative appraisals about themselves others and the world because of the occurrence and the content of their psychotic symptoms Shame fear of recurrence intolerance to uncertainty and perception of losing control of ones mind were demonstrated as significantly related to PTSDPP A perception of current threat then settled leading to adaptation strategies possibly psychotic themselves to avoid intrusions and others indices about their past psychotic episode Thus reliving syndrome avoidance emotional numbing could simulate a new psychotic exacerbation to an outerobserverConclusionA psychotic experience could be traumatic for patients and lead to complete PTSD Although it appears as a

post-traumatic stress disorder,A growing literature shows prominent sex effects for risk for posttraumatic stress disorder and associated medical comorbid burden Previous research indicates that posttraumatic stress disorder is associated with reduced slow wave sleep which may have implications for overall health and abnormalities in rapid eye movement sleep which have been implicated in specific posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms but most research has been conducted in male subjects We therefore sought to compare objective measures of sleep in male and female posttraumatic stress disorder subjects with age and sexmatched control subjects We used a crosssectional design posttraumatic stress disordercontrol femalemale involving83 medically healthy nonmedicated adults aged years in the inpatient sleep laboratory Visual electroencephalographic analysis demonstrated that posttraumatic stress disorder was associated with lower slow wave sleep duration F P and slow wave sleep percentage F P There was also a group sex interaction effect for rapid eye movement sleep duration F P
post-traumatic stress disorder,and rapid eye movement sleep percentage F P explained by greater rapid eye movement sleep in posttraumatic stress disorder females compared to control females a difference not seen in male subjects Quantitative electroencephalography analysis demonstrated that posttraumatic stress disorder was associated with lower energy in the delta spectrum F P in nonrapid eye movement sleep Slow wave sleep and delta findings were more pronounced in males Removal of posttraumatic stress disorder subjects with comorbid major depressive disorder who had greater posttraumatic stress disorder severity strengthened delta effects but reduced rapid eye movement effects to nonsignificance These findings support previous evidence that posttraumatic stress disorder is associated with impairment in the homeostatic function of sleep especially in men with the disorder These findings suggest that group sex interaction effects on rapid eye movement may occur with more severe posttraumatic stress disorder or with posttraumatic stress disorder comorbid with major depressive disorder
post-traumatic stress disorder,IntroductionPosttraumatic stress disorder PTSD is characterised by intrusive anxious and avoidant symptoms that are triggered after a stressful experience and affect the mood The definition of a stressor that generates PTSD has been debated in recent years as a clinical picture compatible with the disorder can occur after exposure to stressors that do not meet the criteria A1 of the DSM V these stressors have been defined in the literature as of low magnitude uncommon unusual or atypicalClinical caseWe present the clinical case of a paediatric patient who developed PTSD after being exposed to an atypical stressorConclusionsThe literature shows these stressors to be more frequently documented in the paediatric population We therefore suggest that cases should be analysed as a complex interweaving of variables where one of the most important is each patients interpretation of the event according to their life history and social context and not because of an

post-traumatic stress disorder,BackgroundThis article reviews the current debate on developmental trauma disorder DTD with respect to formalizing its diagnostic criteria Victims of abuse neglect and maltreatment in childhood often develop a wide range of agedependent psychopathologies with various mental comorbidities The supporters of a formal DTD diagnosis argue that posttraumatic stress disorder PTSD does not cover all consequences of severe and complex traumatization in childhoodDiscussionTraumatized individuals are difficult to treat but clinical experience has shown that they tend to benefit from specific trauma therapy A main argument against inclusion of formal DTD criteria into existing diagnostic systems is that emphasis on the etiology of the disorder might force current diagnostic systems to deviate from their purely descriptive nature Furthermore comorbidities and biological aspects of the disorder may be underdiagnosed using the DTD criteriaSummaryHere we discuss arguments for and against the proposal of DTD criteria and address implications and consequences for the clinical

post-traumatic stress disorder,Posttraumatic stress disorder PTSD previously known as battle fatigue syndrome or shell shock is a severe mental disturbance condition that is normally triggered by the experience of some frighteningscary events or trauma where a person undergoes some serious physical or mental harm or threatened PTSD is a longlife effect of the continuous occurrence of traumatic conditions leading to the production of feelings of helplessness intense fear and horror in the person There are various examples of events that can cause PTSD such as physical mental or sexual assault at home or working place by others unexpected death of a loved one an accidental event war or some kind of natural disaster Treatment of PTSD includes the removal or reduction of these emotional feelings or symptoms with the aim to improve the daily life functioning of a person Problems which are needed to be considered in case of PTSD like ongoing
post-traumatic stress disorder,While posttraumatic stress disorder PTSD is currently diagnosed based solely on classic psychological and behavioral symptoms a growing body of evidence has highlighted a link between this disorder and alterations in the immune and inflammatory systems Epidemiological studies have demonstrated that PTSD is associated with significantly increased rates of physical comorbidities in which immune dysregulation is involved such as metabolic syndrome atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and autoimmune diseases In line with this a number of blood biomarker studies have reported that compared to healthy controls individuals with PTSD exhibit significantly elevated levels of proinflammatory markers such as interleukin1 interleukin tumor necrosis factor and Creactive protein Moreover various lines of animal and human research have suggested that inflammation is not only associated with PTSD but also can play an important role in its pathogenesis and pathophysiology In this review we first summarize evidence suggestive of increased inflammation in PTSD We then examine

post-traumatic stress disorder,Posttraumatic stress disorder PTSD was first introduced as a diagnosis by the American Psychiatric Association in 1980 This diagnosis included in the 3rd edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of the American Psychiatric Association DSMIII was to be considered after someone was exposed to a traumatic event outside the range of usual human experience and would be markedly distressing to almost anyone Since then trauma survivors have been identified as being at risk for the development of posttraumatic stress symptom PTSS and posttraumatic stress disorder PTSD Despite the recognition of this fact the screening recognition and diagnosis of PTSD in these atrisk populations are inconsistent In the following review which is designed for the clinician who is unfamiliar with PTSD and its recognition diagnosis and treatment we introduce the problem in the trauma patient and define its scope In addition we discuss the diagnosis of PTSD in trauma patients
post-traumatic stress disorder,PostTraumatic Stress Disorder PTSD is a disorder that develops following the experience of a highly stressful event which involves a confrontation with death or the threat of death serious injury or sexual violence It is characterized by symptoms such as intrusions avoidance and hypervigilance According to the literature PTSD is associated with an imbalance between a privileged memorization of the emotional and sensory aspects of the traumatic event and a failure to memorize the contextual aspects That is why PTSD is now considered a memory disorder whose effects extend to several components In this review article we focus on how PTSD affects longterm memory The first part describes the longterm effects of PTSD on episodic memory with emphasis on the difficulties in encoding certain elements of the traumatic event and their consequences These difficulties may be manifested in the narration of the trauma with a discourse of the traumatic event
post-traumatic stress disorder,lacking in contextual details They may also lead to reliving and generalizing the fear to other contexts whether they are related to the trauma or not The second part of the article discusses how PTSD affects autobiographical memory and has consequences for the construction of identity and the perception of the past present and future of people with this disorder Autobiographical memory which plays a key role in the storage of past personal memories as well as in identity formation shows several forms of disruption induced by PTSD First a decrease in contextual details associated with memories of the personal past is observed meaning that people with PTSD tend to remember their past experiences less accurately Second a propensity to project the future in a more negative and unpredictable manner is evidenced related to a feeling of uncertainty about the future in PTSD suffering individuals Finally alterations in the encoding
post-traumatic stress disorder,BackgroundThe update of the PostTraumatic Stress Disorder PTSD in the fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders DSM5 emphasizes the definition of psychological traumatism as an objective and external event Nevertheless the scientific debate about the criteriology of PTSD its clinical pertinence for application and the role of subjective dimension appears still open Although the relation between psychotrauma and psychosis has been well examined in the way of trauma as a risk factor for the development of schizophrenia the potential traumatism represented by the psychotic experience seems to be less knownObjectiveThis paper aims to provide a state of the art about the PTSD in reaction to psychosis defined as PTSD post psychosis PTSDPP particularly in epidemiological and psychopathological termsMethodsWe performed a bibliographic research on Pubmed using the keywords posttraumatic stress disorder psychological trauma schizophrenia review psychosis first episode psychosis recovery schizophrenia with a first screening on

post-traumatic stress disorder,presented a complete posttraumatic symptomatology in reaction to psychosis suggesting that the supposed psychotic residual symptoms after acute phase could referr to actual traumatic reactions The PTSDPP process observed in descriptive research and patients interviews appeared congruent with the cognitive model of PTSD elaborated by Ehlers and Clark Indeed psychotic patients developed negative appraisals about themselves others and the world because of the occurrence and the content of their psychotic symptoms Shame fear of recurrence intolerance to uncertainty and perception of losing control of ones mind were demonstrated as significantly related to PTSDPP A perception of current threat then settled leading to adaptation strategies possibly psychotic themselves to avoid intrusions and others indices about their past psychotic episode Thus reliving syndrome avoidance emotional numbing could simulate a new psychotic exacerbation to an outerobserverConclusionA psychotic experience could be traumatic for patients and lead to complete PTSD Although it appears as a

post-traumatic stress disorder,A growing literature shows prominent sex effects for risk for posttraumatic stress disorder and associated medical comorbid burden Previous research indicates that posttraumatic stress disorder is associated with reduced slow wave sleep which may have implications for overall health and abnormalities in rapid eye movement sleep which have been implicated in specific posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms but most research has been conducted in male subjects We therefore sought to compare objective measures of sleep in male and female posttraumatic stress disorder subjects with age and sexmatched control subjects We used a crosssectional design posttraumatic stress disordercontrol femalemale involving83 medically healthy nonmedicated adults aged years in the inpatient sleep laboratory Visual electroencephalographic analysis demonstrated that posttraumatic stress disorder was associated with lower slow wave sleep duration F P and slow wave sleep percentage F P There was also a group sex interaction effect for rapid eye movement sleep duration F P
post-traumatic stress disorder,and rapid eye movement sleep percentage F P explained by greater rapid eye movement sleep in posttraumatic stress disorder females compared to control females a difference not seen in male subjects Quantitative electroencephalography analysis demonstrated that posttraumatic stress disorder was associated with lower energy in the delta spectrum F P in nonrapid eye movement sleep Slow wave sleep and delta findings were more pronounced in males Removal of posttraumatic stress disorder subjects with comorbid major depressive disorder who had greater posttraumatic stress disorder severity strengthened delta effects but reduced rapid eye movement effects to nonsignificance These findings support previous evidence that posttraumatic stress disorder is associated with impairment in the homeostatic function of sleep especially in men with the disorder These findings suggest that group sex interaction effects on rapid eye movement may occur with more severe posttraumatic stress disorder or with posttraumatic stress disorder comorbid with major depressive disorder
post-traumatic stress disorder,IntroductionPosttraumatic stress disorder PTSD is characterised by intrusive anxious and avoidant symptoms that are triggered after a stressful experience and affect the mood The definition of a stressor that generates PTSD has been debated in recent years as a clinical picture compatible with the disorder can occur after exposure to stressors that do not meet the criteria A1 of the DSM V these stressors have been defined in the literature as of low magnitude uncommon unusual or atypicalClinical caseWe present the clinical case of a paediatric patient who developed PTSD after being exposed to an atypical stressorConclusionsThe literature shows these stressors to be more frequently documented in the paediatric population We therefore suggest that cases should be analysed as a complex interweaving of variables where one of the most important is each patients interpretation of the event according to their life history and social context and not because of an

post-traumatic stress disorder,Posttraumatic stress disorder PTSD previously known as battle fatigue syndrome or shell shock is a severe mental disturbance condition that is normally triggered by the experience of some frighteningscary events or trauma where a person undergoes some serious physical or mental harm or threatened PTSD is a longlife effect of the continuous occurrence of traumatic conditions leading to the production of feelings of helplessness intense fear and horror in the person There are various examples of events that can cause PTSD such as physical mental or sexual assault at home or working place by others unexpected death of a loved one an accidental event war or some kind of natural disaster Treatment of PTSD includes the removal or reduction of these emotional feelings or symptoms with the aim to improve the daily life functioning of a person Problems which are needed to be considered in case of PTSD like ongoing
post-traumatic stress disorder,While posttraumatic stress disorder PTSD is currently diagnosed based solely on classic psychological and behavioral symptoms a growing body of evidence has highlighted a link between this disorder and alterations in the immune and inflammatory systems Epidemiological studies have demonstrated that PTSD is associated with significantly increased rates of physical comorbidities in which immune dysregulation is involved such as metabolic syndrome atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and autoimmune diseases In line with this a number of blood biomarker studies have reported that compared to healthy controls individuals with PTSD exhibit significantly elevated levels of proinflammatory markers such as interleukin1 interleukin tumor necrosis factor and Creactive protein Moreover various lines of animal and human research have suggested that inflammation is not only associated with PTSD but also can play an important role in its pathogenesis and pathophysiology In this review we first summarize evidence suggestive of increased inflammation in PTSD We then examine

post-traumatic stress disorder,Posttraumatic stress disorder PTSD was first introduced as a diagnosis by the American Psychiatric Association in 1980 This diagnosis included in the 3rd edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of the American Psychiatric Association DSMIII was to be considered after someone was exposed to a traumatic event outside the range of usual human experience and would be markedly distressing to almost anyone Since then trauma survivors have been identified as being at risk for the development of posttraumatic stress symptom PTSS and posttraumatic stress disorder PTSD Despite the recognition of this fact the screening recognition and diagnosis of PTSD in these atrisk populations are inconsistent In the following review which is designed for the clinician who is unfamiliar with PTSD and its recognition diagnosis and treatment we introduce the problem in the trauma patient and define its scope In addition we discuss the diagnosis of PTSD in trauma patients
post-traumatic stress disorder,PostTraumatic Stress Disorder PTSD is a disorder that develops following the experience of a highly stressful event which involves a confrontation with death or the threat of death serious injury or sexual violence It is characterized by symptoms such as intrusions avoidance and hypervigilance According to the literature PTSD is associated with an imbalance between a privileged memorization of the emotional and sensory aspects of the traumatic event and a failure to memorize the contextual aspects That is why PTSD is now considered a memory disorder whose effects extend to several components In this review article we focus on how PTSD affects longterm memory The first part describes the longterm effects of PTSD on episodic memory with emphasis on the difficulties in encoding certain elements of the traumatic event and their consequences These difficulties may be manifested in the narration of the trauma with a discourse of the traumatic event
post-traumatic stress disorder,lacking in contextual details They may also lead to reliving and generalizing the fear to other contexts whether they are related to the trauma or not The second part of the article discusses how PTSD affects autobiographical memory and has consequences for the construction of identity and the perception of the past present and future of people with this disorder Autobiographical memory which plays a key role in the storage of past personal memories as well as in identity formation shows several forms of disruption induced by PTSD First a decrease in contextual details associated with memories of the personal past is observed meaning that people with PTSD tend to remember their past experiences less accurately Second a propensity to project the future in a more negative and unpredictable manner is evidenced related to a feeling of uncertainty about the future in PTSD suffering individuals Finally alterations in the encoding
post-traumatic stress disorder,BackgroundThe update of the PostTraumatic Stress Disorder PTSD in the fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders DSM5 emphasizes the definition of psychological traumatism as an objective and external event Nevertheless the scientific debate about the criteriology of PTSD its clinical pertinence for application and the role of subjective dimension appears still open Although the relation between psychotrauma and psychosis has been well examined in the way of trauma as a risk factor for the development of schizophrenia the potential traumatism represented by the psychotic experience seems to be less knownObjectiveThis paper aims to provide a state of the art about the PTSD in reaction to psychosis defined as PTSD post psychosis PTSDPP particularly in epidemiological and psychopathological termsMethodsWe performed a bibliographic research on Pubmed using the keywords posttraumatic stress disorder psychological trauma schizophrenia review psychosis first episode psychosis recovery schizophrenia with a first screening on

post-traumatic stress disorder,presented a complete posttraumatic symptomatology in reaction to psychosis suggesting that the supposed psychotic residual symptoms after acute phase could referr to actual traumatic reactions The PTSDPP process observed in descriptive research and patients interviews appeared congruent with the cognitive model of PTSD elaborated by Ehlers and Clark Indeed psychotic patients developed negative appraisals about themselves others and the world because of the occurrence and the content of their psychotic symptoms Shame fear of recurrence intolerance to uncertainty and perception of losing control of ones mind were demonstrated as significantly related to PTSDPP A perception of current threat then settled leading to adaptation strategies possibly psychotic themselves to avoid intrusions and others indices about their past psychotic episode Thus reliving syndrome avoidance emotional numbing could simulate a new psychotic exacerbation to an outerobserverConclusionA psychotic experience could be traumatic for patients and lead to complete PTSD Although it appears as a

post-traumatic stress disorder,presented a complete posttraumatic symptomatology in reaction to psychosis suggesting that the supposed psychotic residual symptoms after acute phase could referr to actual traumatic reactions The PTSDPP process observed in descriptive research and patients interviews appeared congruent with the cognitive model of PTSD elaborated by Ehlers and Clark Indeed psychotic patients developed negative appraisals about themselves others and the world because of the occurrence and the content of their psychotic symptoms Shame fear of recurrence intolerance to uncertainty and perception of losing control of ones mind were demonstrated as significantly related to PTSDPP A perception of current threat then settled leading to adaptation strategies possibly psychotic themselves to avoid intrusions and others indices about their past psychotic episode Thus reliving syndrome avoidance emotional numbing could simulate a new psychotic exacerbation to an outerobserverConclusionA psychotic experience could be traumatic for patients and lead to complete PTSD Although it appears as a

post-traumatic stress disorder,Clinical reports and observations going back almost two centuries consistently indicate that hypnotherapy is an effective modality for the treatment of post traumatic stress disorder PTSD Pierre Janet was the first clinician to describe the successful initiation of stepwise hypnotic techniques in PTSD symptom reduction Hypnotherapy may accelerate the formation of a therapeutic alliance and contribute to a positive treatment outcome Hypnotic techniques may be valuable for patients with PTSD who exhibit symptoms such as anxiety dissociation widespread somatoform pain complaints and sleep disturbances Hypnotic techniques may also facilitate the arduous tasks of working through traumatic memories increasing coping skills and promoting a sense of competency In this review we will present guidelines for the stepwise implementation of hypnotherapy in PTSD Since most data regarding the use of hypnotherapy in PTSD has been gathered from uncontrolled clinical observations methodologically sound research demonstrating the efficacy of hypnotic techniques in PTSD is
post-traumatic stress disorder,A growing literature shows prominent sex effects for risk for posttraumatic stress disorder and associated medical comorbid burden Previous research indicates that posttraumatic stress disorder is associated with reduced slow wave sleep which may have implications for overall health and abnormalities in rapid eye movement sleep which have been implicated in specific posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms but most research has been conducted in male subjects We therefore sought to compare objective measures of sleep in male and female posttraumatic stress disorder subjects with age and sexmatched control subjects We used a crosssectional design posttraumatic stress disordercontrol femalemale involving83 medically healthy nonmedicated adults aged years in the inpatient sleep laboratory Visual electroencephalographic analysis demonstrated that posttraumatic stress disorder was associated with lower slow wave sleep duration F P and slow wave sleep percentage F P There was also a group sex interaction effect for rapid eye movement sleep duration F P
post-traumatic stress disorder,and rapid eye movement sleep percentage F P explained by greater rapid eye movement sleep in posttraumatic stress disorder females compared to control females a difference not seen in male subjects Quantitative electroencephalography analysis demonstrated that posttraumatic stress disorder was associated with lower energy in the delta spectrum F P in nonrapid eye movement sleep Slow wave sleep and delta findings were more pronounced in males Removal of posttraumatic stress disorder subjects with comorbid major depressive disorder who had greater posttraumatic stress disorder severity strengthened delta effects but reduced rapid eye movement effects to nonsignificance These findings support previous evidence that posttraumatic stress disorder is associated with impairment in the homeostatic function of sleep especially in men with the disorder These findings suggest that group sex interaction effects on rapid eye movement may occur with more severe posttraumatic stress disorder or with posttraumatic stress disorder comorbid with major depressive disorder
post-traumatic stress disorder,IntroductionPosttraumatic stress disorder PTSD is characterised by intrusive anxious and avoidant symptoms that are triggered after a stressful experience and affect the mood The definition of a stressor that generates PTSD has been debated in recent years as a clinical picture compatible with the disorder can occur after exposure to stressors that do not meet the criteria A1 of the DSM V these stressors have been defined in the literature as of low magnitude uncommon unusual or atypicalClinical caseWe present the clinical case of a paediatric patient who developed PTSD after being exposed to an atypical stressorConclusionsThe literature shows these stressors to be more frequently documented in the paediatric population We therefore suggest that cases should be analysed as a complex interweaving of variables where one of the most important is each patients interpretation of the event according to their life history and social context and not because of an

post-traumatic stress disorder,There is a small body of research about mental and physical comorbidity in posttraumatic stress disorder PTSD patients despite the fact that some psychiatric disorders and physical conditions are commonly comorbid with PTSD In this study we researched the relationship between PTSD and its mental and physical comorbidities by comparing the number of patient hospitalizations across two tenyear periods Our sample consisted of patients with warfare PTSD hospitalized during the year period 19992018 The results confirmed a higher number of hospitalizations in the 20092018 period than in the 19992008 period for the group of PTSD patients with both mental and physical comorbidity Furthermore no significant difference was found in the number of hospitalizations between the two tenyear periods for the group of PTSD patients with mental comorbidity We argued that both mental and physical comorbidities along with PTSD are needed to induce a significantly higher level of distress in patients

post-traumatic stress disorder,There is increasing recognition of emotions other than fear in posttraumatic stress disorder PTSD and recent research has looked at the role of shame Cognitive theory suggests that PTSD is caused by traumatic experiences being processed in a way that causes ongoing current threat In this paper we suggest that shame might contribute to the creationmaintenance of ongoing current threat as it attacks an individuals psychological integrity A correlational design was used to investigate some of the factors that might contribute to a shame response within a PTSD sample It was hypothesized that individuals with PTSD who report higher levels of shame would be more prone to engage in selfcritical thinking and less prone to engage in selfreassuring thinking than individuals with PTSD who report lower levels of shame Data were gathered using selfreport questionnaires and results supported the hypotheses It is suggested therapy for shamebased PTSD needs to incorporate
post-traumatic stress disorder,Posttraumatic stress disorder PTSD previously known as battle fatigue syndrome or shell shock is a severe mental disturbance condition that is normally triggered by the experience of some frighteningscary events or trauma where a person undergoes some serious physical or mental harm or threatened PTSD is a longlife effect of the continuous occurrence of traumatic conditions leading to the production of feelings of helplessness intense fear and horror in the person There are various examples of events that can cause PTSD such as physical mental or sexual assault at home or working place by others unexpected death of a loved one an accidental event war or some kind of natural disaster Treatment of PTSD includes the removal or reduction of these emotional feelings or symptoms with the aim to improve the daily life functioning of a person Problems which are needed to be considered in case of PTSD like ongoing
post-traumatic stress disorder,While posttraumatic stress disorder PTSD is currently diagnosed based solely on classic psychological and behavioral symptoms a growing body of evidence has highlighted a link between this disorder and alterations in the immune and inflammatory systems Epidemiological studies have demonstrated that PTSD is associated with significantly increased rates of physical comorbidities in which immune dysregulation is involved such as metabolic syndrome atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and autoimmune diseases In line with this a number of blood biomarker studies have reported that compared to healthy controls individuals with PTSD exhibit significantly elevated levels of proinflammatory markers such as interleukin1 interleukin tumor necrosis factor and Creactive protein Moreover various lines of animal and human research have suggested that inflammation is not only associated with PTSD but also can play an important role in its pathogenesis and pathophysiology In this review we first summarize evidence suggestive of increased inflammation in PTSD We then examine

post-traumatic stress disorder,Posttraumatic stress disorder PTSD was first introduced as a diagnosis by the American Psychiatric Association in 1980 This diagnosis included in the 3rd edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of the American Psychiatric Association DSMIII was to be considered after someone was exposed to a traumatic event outside the range of usual human experience and would be markedly distressing to almost anyone Since then trauma survivors have been identified as being at risk for the development of posttraumatic stress symptom PTSS and posttraumatic stress disorder PTSD Despite the recognition of this fact the screening recognition and diagnosis of PTSD in these atrisk populations are inconsistent In the following review which is designed for the clinician who is unfamiliar with PTSD and its recognition diagnosis and treatment we introduce the problem in the trauma patient and define its scope In addition we discuss the diagnosis of PTSD in trauma patients
post-traumatic stress disorder,PostTraumatic Stress Disorder PTSD is a disorder that develops following the experience of a highly stressful event which involves a confrontation with death or the threat of death serious injury or sexual violence It is characterized by symptoms such as intrusions avoidance and hypervigilance According to the literature PTSD is associated with an imbalance between a privileged memorization of the emotional and sensory aspects of the traumatic event and a failure to memorize the contextual aspects That is why PTSD is now considered a memory disorder whose effects extend to several components In this review article we focus on how PTSD affects longterm memory The first part describes the longterm effects of PTSD on episodic memory with emphasis on the difficulties in encoding certain elements of the traumatic event and their consequences These difficulties may be manifested in the narration of the trauma with a discourse of the traumatic event
post-traumatic stress disorder,lacking in contextual details They may also lead to reliving and generalizing the fear to other contexts whether they are related to the trauma or not The second part of the article discusses how PTSD affects autobiographical memory and has consequences for the construction of identity and the perception of the past present and future of people with this disorder Autobiographical memory which plays a key role in the storage of past personal memories as well as in identity formation shows several forms of disruption induced by PTSD First a decrease in contextual details associated with memories of the personal past is observed meaning that people with PTSD tend to remember their past experiences less accurately Second a propensity to project the future in a more negative and unpredictable manner is evidenced related to a feeling of uncertainty about the future in PTSD suffering individuals Finally alterations in the encoding

schizophrenia,Epigenetic modifications are increasingly recognized to play a role in the etiology and pathophysiology of schizophrenia and other psychiatric disorders with developmental origins Here we summarize clinical and preclinical findings of epigenetic alterations in schizophrenia and relevant disease models and discuss their putative origin Recent findings suggest that certain schizophrenia risk loci can influence stochastic variation in gene expression through epigenetic processes highlighting the intricate interaction between genetic and epigenetic control of neurodevelopmental trajectories In addition a substantial portion of epigenetic alterations in schizophrenia and related disorders may be acquired through environmental factors and may be manifested as molecular scars Some of these scars can influence brain functions throughout the entire lifespan and may even be transmitted across generations via epigenetic germline inheritance Epigenetic modifications whether caused by genetic or environmental factors are plausible molecular sources of phenotypic heterogeneity and offer a target for therapeutic interventions The further elucidation of

schizophrenia,New findings are rapidly revealing an increasingly detailed image of neural and molecularlevel dysfunction in schizophrenia distributed throughout interconnected corticostriatopallidothalamic circuitry Some disturbances appear to reflect failures of early brain maturation that become codified into dysfunctional circuit properties resulting in a substantial loss of or failure to develop both cells andor appropriate connectivity across widely dispersed brain regions These circuit disturbances are variable across individuals with schizophrenia perhaps reflecting the interaction of multiple different risk genes and epigenetic events Given these complex and variable hardwired circuit disturbances it is worth considering how new and emerging findings can be integrated into actionable treatment models This paper suggests that future efforts towards developing more effective therapeutic approaches for the schizophrenias should diverge from prevailing models in genetics and molecular neuroscience and focus instead on a more practical threepart treatment strategy systematic rehabilitative psychotherapies designed to engage healthy neural systems to compensate for
schizophrenia,BackgroundDiagnostic criteria for mental disorders are subject to change This is particularly true for schizophrenia whose diagnostic criteria in the current DSM bear little resemblance to what Kraepelin once named dementia praecox and Bleuler termed the schizophrenias The present study reports results from a survey of experts on two core topics of schizophrenia a whether subsequent editions of the DSM should once again give the Schneiderian firstrank symptoms FRS eg thought broadcasting the prominent role they had in the DSMIV and b whether the currently quite narrow definition of hallucinations in the DSM requiring them to be vivid and clear and have the full force and impact of normal perceptions should be broadened to incorporate perceptuallike phenomena that the individual can differentiate from proper perceptions but still perceives as real and externally generatedHypothesisThe aim of the survey was to learn about experts opinions with no clear hypothesesStudy designInternational experts on
schizophrenia,schizophrenia were recruited via various sources and invited to participate in a short online survey The final sample comprised experts with a subgroup of experts with verified identity and at least years of clinical andor research experienceStudy resultsSlightly more experts voted in favor of returning FRS to the prominent role they had in earlier versions of the DSM than against Approximately four out of five experts agreed that the definition of hallucinations in the DSM should be expanded According to the results alongside internal symptoms that are phenomenologically indistinguishable from true perceptions sensory intrusions that the holder is convinced were inserted from another source ie not selfgenerated should be included in the definitionConclusionsWhile a large majority of experts recommend a change in the definition of hallucinations the experts opinions on FRS are more mixed We hope that this article will stimulate future studies targeting the diagnostic relevance of these symptoms

schizophrenia,Although the etiology of schizophrenia is still unknown it is accepted to be a neurodevelopmental disorder that results from the interaction of genetic vulnerabilities and environmental insults Although schizophrenias pathophysiology is still unclear postmortem studies point toward a dysfunction of cortical interneurons as a central element It has been suggested that alterations in parvalbuminpositive interneurons in schizophrenia are the consequence of a deficient signaling through NMDARs Animal studies demonstrated that early postnatal ablation of the NMDAR in corticolimbic interneurons induces neurobiochemical physiological behavioral and epidemiological phenotypes related to schizophrenia Notably the behavioral abnormalities emerge only after animals complete their maturation during adolescence and are absent if the NMDAR is deleted during adulthood This suggests that interneuron dysfunction must interact with development to impact on behavior Here we assessin vivohow an early NMDAR ablation in corticolimbic interneurons impacts on mPFC and ventral hippocampus functional connectivity before and after adolescence In juvenile

schizophrenia,Ever since the distinction between praecox dementia and manicdepressive illness made by Kraepelin in many changes have occurred in the way these conditions and especially their boundaries are conceived The clearest example is the extraordinary increase in the diagnoses of bipolar disease with respect to those of schizophrenia But there have also been important changes within each one of these categories In the first case the separation of schizo affective and cycloid psychoses and in the second the distinction between mono and bipolar disease Then there is the description of innumerable forms of monopolar depression1 or on the contrary the postulation of the existence of only one endogenousmelancholic syndrome by Tellenbach an idea which is shall come up again although from another methodological perspective in the concept of major depression of DSM III The present author thinks that this state of nosological confusion has to do on one hand with
schizophrenia,the improper combination of descriptive and etiological criteriaand on the other with the application of categorical criteria to complex realities without an organic basis supporting themThe present author proposes a logopathiesthymopathies dichotomy The first would include all forms of schizophreniaparaphrenias and paranoias The second would correspond to the affective disorders and also to a great part of the so called anxiety disorders In this first part he develops the subject of the logopathies trying to demonstrate the legitimacy of the concept upon the basis of three fundamental arguments i Alteration of the thoughtlanguage as a nucleus of schizophrenic suffering ii Schizophrenia is a constitutive element of the human condition And iiiSchizophrenia appears as a perturbation of Verstehen understandingas described by Heidegger in Being and Time as one of the ways Dasein human being is present in the world together with Befindlichkeit attunement or stateof mindwhich is precisely what would be

schizophrenia,Atypical antipsychotics are widely used to manage schizophrenia symptoms However these drugs can induce deleterious side effects such as MetS which are associated with an increased cardiovascular risk to patients Lipids play a central role in this context and changes in lipid metabolism have been implicated in schizophrenias pathobiology Furthermore recent evidence suggests that lipidome changes may be related to antipsychotic treatment response The aim of this study was to evaluate the lipidome changes in blood plasma samples of schizophrenia patients before and after weeks of treatment with either risperidone olanzapine or quetiapine Liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry LCMSMS analysis showed changes in the levels of ceramides Cer glycerophosphatidic acids PA glycerophosphocholines PC phosphatidylethanolamines PE phosphatidylinositols PI glycerophosphoglycerols PG and phosphatidylserines PS for all treatments However the treatment with risperidone also affected diacylglycerides DG ceramide phosphates CerP triglycerides TG sphingomyelins SM and ceramide phosphoinositols PICer Moreover specific lipid profiles were

schizophrenia,The author stresses the lack of nosological entities in psychiatry and also the necessity of a classification system Paranoid symptoms are found in most types of psychoses both functional and organic psychoses Among the functional psychoses the schizophrenias often have a paranoid picture and paranoid traits may be found even in the affective psychoses The Scandinavian concept of reactive psychoses is presented including reactive psychoses is presented including reactive psychoses of paranoiac paranoid and schizophreniform type Finally the author presents his own personal followup study of paranoid psychoses after an observation time of years This study demonstrates cured of the patients with the discharge diagnosis of reactive psychoses as against cured of the patients with the discharge diagnosis of schizophrenia The author suggests a continuum of the paranoid psychoses from the schizophrenias via the schizophreniform and paranoid reactive psychoses to the more affective psychoses with slight tendency to paranoid symptomatology
schizophrenia,As the endogeneous psychoses do not show a Mendelian mode of inheritance empirical risk figures have to be calculated They are heterogeneous and nurture as well as nature have a share in the manifestation of illness The genetic basis of the schizophrenias is demonstrated by twin and adoption studies The concordance rate in monozygotic twins is four times the rate in dizygotic twins Schizophrenia is to be found in the biological families of schizophrenic adoptees but not in the adoptive families However despite their genetic identity monozygotic twins do not show concordance but only Nongenetic factors must be considered Obviously they are nonspecific and vary between individuals The same principles apply to the affective psychoses At present research is most interested in the problem of heterogeneity Do pure depressive and manicdepressive disease form one genetic entity or two different ones or have they in common part of their genetic basis

schizophrenia,In addition to genetic findings and treatment response the course prognosis is also meant to be a possible validating criterion for diagnosis and diagnostic systems In our study we used the polydiagnostic approach ie the simultaneous application of various criteria for diagnosing a given disorder to one and the same population to test the ability of several diagnostic systems to create homogeneous groups regarding the course episodicchronic We applied Schneiders FRS ICD DSMIII Spitzers RDC and the Vienna Research Criteria to patients with the diagnosis of delusional syndrome aside from any nosological classification who underwent years of followup At the index examination schizophrenia was most frequently diagnosed with Schneiders FRS which apparently encompasses a very heterogeneous group of patients regarding psychopathology and course Diagnostic systems which allowed the diagnosis of affective disorders despite the presence of moodincongruent delusional symptomatology DSMIII RDC Vienna Criteria or offered the diagnosis of schizoaffective disorder

schizophrenia,Although dementia praecox or schizophrenia has been considered a unique disease for over a century its definitions and boundaries have changed over this period and its etiology and pathophysiology remain elusive Despite changing definitions DSMIV schizophrenia is reliably diagnosed has fair validity and conveys useful clinical information Therefore the essence of the broad DSMIV definition of schizophrenia is retained in DSM The clinical manifestations are extremely diverse however with this heterogeneity being poorly explained by the DSMIV clinical subtypes and course specifiers Additionally the boundaries of schizophrenia are imprecisely demarcated from schizoaffective disorder and other diagnostic categories and its special emphasis on Schneiderian firstrank symptoms appears misplaced Changes in the definition of schizophrenia in DSM seek to address these shortcomings and incorporate the new information about the nature of the disorder accumulated over the past two decades Specific changes in its definition include elimination of the classic subtypes addition of

schizophrenia,There has been substantial progress in understanding the genetics of schizophrenia over the past years This has revealed a highly polygenic condition with the majority of the currently explained heritability coming from common alleles of small effect but with additional contributions from rare copy number and coding variants Many specific genes and loci have been implicated that provide a firm basis upon which mechanistic research can proceed These point to disturbances in neuronal and particularly synaptic functions that are not confined to a small number of brain regions and circuits Genetic findings have also revealed the nature of schizophrenias close relationship to other conditions particularly bipolar disorder and childhood neurodevelopmental disorders and provided an explanation for how common risk alleles persist in the population in the face of reduced fecundity Current genomic approaches only potentially explain around of heritability but only a small proportion of this is attributable to robustly

schizophrenia,Epigenetic modifications are increasingly recognized to play a role in the etiology and pathophysiology of schizophrenia and other psychiatric disorders with developmental origins Here we summarize clinical and preclinical findings of epigenetic alterations in schizophrenia and relevant disease models and discuss their putative origin Recent findings suggest that certain schizophrenia risk loci can influence stochastic variation in gene expression through epigenetic processes highlighting the intricate interaction between genetic and epigenetic control of neurodevelopmental trajectories In addition a substantial portion of epigenetic alterations in schizophrenia and related disorders may be acquired through environmental factors and may be manifested as molecular scars Some of these scars can influence brain functions throughout the entire lifespan and may even be transmitted across generations via epigenetic germline inheritance Epigenetic modifications whether caused by genetic or environmental factors are plausible molecular sources of phenotypic heterogeneity and offer a target for therapeutic interventions The further elucidation of

schizophrenia,BackgroundThe latency of the P300 eventrelated potential is prolonged in disorders associated with neural damage and degeneration and also becomes prolonged in the course of neural changes that accompany aging We tested whether the rate of P300 latency increase with age was greater in male schizophrenic patients than in normal subjects because a steeper slope in schizophrenia would suggest a progressive neurodegenerative process We also evaluated a subset of these subjects for changes in brain volumes as determined by magnetic resonance imagingMethodThe P300 component was elicited during an auditory oddball paradigm and was recorded from male patients with chronic schizophrenia whose mean age at onset was years and from age handedness and gendermatched control subjects The relation of P300 latency and amplitude to age within each group was evaluated using correlation and regression analyses Brain volumes determined via magnetic resonance imaging were evaluated by quantitative volumetric analyses of images acquired
schizophrenia,with threedimensional Fourier transform and double echospin echopulse sequencesResultsThe slope of P300 latency on age was steeper for schizophrenic patients than for normal control subjects at midline frontal and central electrode sites The slope of N100 latency did not differ implying that the P300 differences were not likely to be due to peripheral hearing loss or damage affecting the initial stages of neural processing Posterior superior temporal gyrus gray matter volume determined via magnetic resonance imaging significantly diminished with age on the left side in patients with schizophrenia but not on the right side or in controls these slopes were not however statistically significantly different from each otherConclusionsThese findings provide preliminary evidence that male patients with chronic schizophrenia experience a neurodegenerative process that becomes evident in adulthood and is reflected by the rate of change of P300 latency with age Whether this process is due to the primary effects of

schizophrenia,Onset of puberty is usually considered to coincide with the last major step in brain development the elimination of some of neuronal synapses Mean pubertal age has declined by some years during the last years There is a relation between age at puberty and body build and between body build and mental illness The difference in body build between schizophrenia S and manicdepressive psychosis MDP is similar to that between late and early maturers It is suggested that S affects latematuring individuals and MDP very early maturers The observed marked rise in MDP and decline in the most malignant forms of S nonparanoid are in agreement with MDP and S as neurodevelopmental disorders occurring at the extremes of maturation Maturational irregularities are most likely to occur at the extremes and it is suggested that abbreviation of the regressive process may have led to persistent redundancy of neuronal synapses in MDP
schizophrenia,Detailed studies of the association between the epilepsies and the schizophrenias extend over years Recent studies are abundant and make fertile use of new technologies However the pathological changes described in schizophrenias are quite varied Studies fail to recognize that epilepsies and schizophrenias have varied in definition over time and have always been weak categories with which to do science Now that it is possible to measure deficits in brain structure it would be better to see what behavioral problems are associated with specific cerebral pathology It would be wise to be very precise in describing the behaviors and the nature and timing of their emergence rather than using terms such as psychoses Schizophrenias have neurological neuropsychological and behavioral antecedents in childhood Those associated with later epilepsies show biases persistent in many studies over a number of years toward relative excess of females left temporal lobe structural deficits and nonrighthandedness

schizophrenia,A preponderance of evidence indicates that the heterogeneous group of schizophrenias is accompanied by disturbances in neural elements distributed throughout multiple levels of interconnected corticostriatopallidothalamic circuitry These disturbances include a substantial loss of or failure to develop both cells andor appropriate cellular connections in regions that include at least portions of the hippocampus parahippocampal gyrus entorhinal cortex amygdala prefrontal and anterior cingulate cortex superior and transverse temporal gyri and mediodorsal anterior and pulvinar nuclei of the thalamus they appear to reflect failures of early brain maturation that become codified into dysfunctional circuit properties that in the opinion of this author cannot be undone or even predictably remediated in any physiological manner by existing pharmacotherapies These circuit disturbances are variable across individuals with schizophrenia perhaps reflecting the interaction of multiple different risk genes and multiple different epigenetic events Evidence for these complex circuit disturbances has significant implications for many areas of

schizophrenia,Epigenetic modifications are increasingly recognized to play a role in the etiology and pathophysiology of schizophrenia and other psychiatric disorders with developmental origins Here we summarize clinical and preclinical findings of epigenetic alterations in schizophrenia and relevant disease models and discuss their putative origin Recent findings suggest that certain schizophrenia risk loci can influence stochastic variation in gene expression through epigenetic processes highlighting the intricate interaction between genetic and epigenetic control of neurodevelopmental trajectories In addition a substantial portion of epigenetic alterations in schizophrenia and related disorders may be acquired through environmental factors and may be manifested as molecular scars Some of these scars can influence brain functions throughout the entire lifespan and may even be transmitted across generations via epigenetic germline inheritance Epigenetic modifications whether caused by genetic or environmental factors are plausible molecular sources of phenotypic heterogeneity and offer a target for therapeutic interventions The further elucidation of

schizophrenia,BackgroundThe latency of the P300 eventrelated potential is prolonged in disorders associated with neural damage and degeneration and also becomes prolonged in the course of neural changes that accompany aging We tested whether the rate of P300 latency increase with age was greater in male schizophrenic patients than in normal subjects because a steeper slope in schizophrenia would suggest a progressive neurodegenerative process We also evaluated a subset of these subjects for changes in brain volumes as determined by magnetic resonance imagingMethodThe P300 component was elicited during an auditory oddball paradigm and was recorded from male patients with chronic schizophrenia whose mean age at onset was years and from age handedness and gendermatched control subjects The relation of P300 latency and amplitude to age within each group was evaluated using correlation and regression analyses Brain volumes determined via magnetic resonance imaging were evaluated by quantitative volumetric analyses of images acquired
schizophrenia,with threedimensional Fourier transform and double echospin echopulse sequencesResultsThe slope of P300 latency on age was steeper for schizophrenic patients than for normal control subjects at midline frontal and central electrode sites The slope of N100 latency did not differ implying that the P300 differences were not likely to be due to peripheral hearing loss or damage affecting the initial stages of neural processing Posterior superior temporal gyrus gray matter volume determined via magnetic resonance imaging significantly diminished with age on the left side in patients with schizophrenia but not on the right side or in controls these slopes were not however statistically significantly different from each otherConclusionsThese findings provide preliminary evidence that male patients with chronic schizophrenia experience a neurodegenerative process that becomes evident in adulthood and is reflected by the rate of change of P300 latency with age Whether this process is due to the primary effects of

schizophrenia,A preponderance of evidence indicates that the heterogeneous group of schizophrenias is accompanied by disturbances in neural elements distributed throughout multiple levels of interconnected corticostriatopallidothalamic circuitry These disturbances include a substantial loss of or failure to develop both cells andor appropriate cellular connections in regions that include at least portions of the hippocampus parahippocampal gyrus entorhinal cortex amygdala prefrontal and anterior cingulate cortex superior and transverse temporal gyri and mediodorsal anterior and pulvinar nuclei of the thalamus they appear to reflect failures of early brain maturation that become codified into dysfunctional circuit properties that in the opinion of this author cannot be undone or even predictably remediated in any physiological manner by existing pharmacotherapies These circuit disturbances are variable across individuals with schizophrenia perhaps reflecting the interaction of multiple different risk genes and multiple different epigenetic events Evidence for these complex circuit disturbances has significant implications for many areas of

schizophrenia,Onset of puberty is usually considered to coincide with the last major step in brain development the elimination of some of neuronal synapses Mean pubertal age has declined by some years during the last years There is a relation between age at puberty and body build and between body build and mental illness The difference in body build between schizophrenia S and manicdepressive psychosis MDP is similar to that between late and early maturers It is suggested that S affects latematuring individuals and MDP very early maturers The observed marked rise in MDP and decline in the most malignant forms of S nonparanoid are in agreement with MDP and S as neurodevelopmental disorders occurring at the extremes of maturation Maturational irregularities are most likely to occur at the extremes and it is suggested that abbreviation of the regressive process may have led to persistent redundancy of neuronal synapses in MDP
schizophrenia,Detailed studies of the association between the epilepsies and the schizophrenias extend over years Recent studies are abundant and make fertile use of new technologies However the pathological changes described in schizophrenias are quite varied Studies fail to recognize that epilepsies and schizophrenias have varied in definition over time and have always been weak categories with which to do science Now that it is possible to measure deficits in brain structure it would be better to see what behavioral problems are associated with specific cerebral pathology It would be wise to be very precise in describing the behaviors and the nature and timing of their emergence rather than using terms such as psychoses Schizophrenias have neurological neuropsychological and behavioral antecedents in childhood Those associated with later epilepsies show biases persistent in many studies over a number of years toward relative excess of females left temporal lobe structural deficits and nonrighthandedness
schizophrenia,Although the term schizophrenia has been introduced in medical usage by E Bleuler all variations of schizophrenia developed afterwards trace back to E Kraepelin In his work on dementia praecox he intended to discover a yet unknown entity from nature definitely following the principles and maxima of positivism In the following a great number of different concepts of schizophrenia were developed and the psychiatrist of the seventies and eighties of the last century was left confronted with an abundance of varying schizophrenic criteria The upcoming globalization in diagnostic stopped this process of diversity and the ideas of Kraepelin reappeared in the ICD criteria for schizophrenia with only a few modifications The main problem of positivistic research approaches is that nature obviously is completely unimpressed by human made principles of rules and systems Nature itself does not know these forms and categories invented by human beings That is one of the

schizophrenia,A preponderance of evidence indicates that the heterogeneous group of schizophrenias is accompanied by disturbances in neural elements distributed throughout multiple levels of interconnected corticostriatopallidothalamic circuitry These disturbances include a substantial loss of or failure to develop both cells andor appropriate cellular connections in regions that include at least portions of the hippocampus parahippocampal gyrus entorhinal cortex amygdala prefrontal and anterior cingulate cortex superior and transverse temporal gyri and mediodorsal anterior and pulvinar nuclei of the thalamus they appear to reflect failures of early brain maturation that become codified into dysfunctional circuit properties that in the opinion of this author cannot be undone or even predictably remediated in any physiological manner by existing pharmacotherapies These circuit disturbances are variable across individuals with schizophrenia perhaps reflecting the interaction of multiple different risk genes and multiple different epigenetic events Evidence for these complex circuit disturbances has significant implications for many areas of
schizophrenia,In this work we attempt to extend to the schizophrenias research the evidence that different frequency bands may emerge from different sources during earlystage visual processing in a mental statespecific manner while subjects are passively viewing a visual stimulus We applied standard pattern reversal stimulation checkerboard a task with low cognitive demands coupled to a dense EEG recording system to estimate the neural correlates of the evoked theta alpha beta beta1 and gamma frequency band responses by means of brain electrical tomography BET After filtering the evoked activity using different bandpasses a very different picture about the current sources during P100 will emerge The results showed notable differences between the two groups In healthy subjects we localized the significances in the anterior cingulate caudate nucleus thalamus precuneous region and superior parietal that were more active for gamma band In patients with schizophrenia differences occupy the hippocampus parahippocampus thalamus midbrain precuneus
schizophrenia,The role of alpha adrenergic receptor sensitivity in schizophrenia was examined by measuring growth hormone GH response after the intravenous administration of clonidine microgramskg in healthy control subjects and neurolepticfree acutely psychotic patients with at least out of possible diagnoses of schizophrenia derived from a multidiagnostic psychopathological assessment GH responses were significantly lower than control values in schizophrenias defined by E Bleuler M Bleuler Schneider Langfeldt Taylor and Abrams and Cloninger but not in DSMIII World Health Organization Feighner Kraepelian and Research Diagnostic Criteria RDC schizophrenias Eight patients with RDC schizoaffective disorder also had a blunted response However there were no correlations with any symptom measures There were no differences between paranoid and nonparanoid patients although there was a significant difference between nonparanoid patients and control subjects These findings support the presence of noradrenergic dysfunction in some patients within the schizophrenia syndrome possibly those whose illnesses have an affective component
schizophrenia,Sex differences with regard to age at first hospitalization and residual symptomatology were investigated in longterm hospitalized chronic schizophrenics Patients fulfilled diagnostic criteria of DSMIII Kraepelins dementia praecox and Leonhards group of schizophrenias as well The severe residual psychopathology necessitated continuous hospitalization in all the patients The women and men neither differed in duration of illness or period of hospitalization nor in their social environment We found that women were older than men at their first hospitalization and exhibited more marked positive symptomatology during the course and in the residual state than men However regardless of the residual symptomatology men generally received more neuroleptics A classification of the schizophrenic patients by means of the Leonhard criteria revealed that unsystematic schizophrenics affectladen paraphrenia periodic catatonia cataphasia of both sexes were significantly p less than more often married at the time of first hospitalization than were systematic schizophrenics Further there was an
schizophrenia,With the exception of one finding in one experiment adoption studies have demonstrated that genetic and not rearing factors play an etiological role in the schizophrenias In that one study clinical evaluations showed the biological parents of schizophrenics as more disturbed than the adopting parents of schizophrenics who were in turn slightly more disturbed than the adopting parents of normal persons Both the biological and the adopting parents of schizophrenics showed an equivalent degree of Rorschach pathology suggesting the possible role of a learned communication disorder in the schizophrenic disorders A replicative study were performed employing the same design but utilizing a systematic sample Structured interviews and tests were administered to the biological parents of nongenetic retardates Structured clinical evaluation showed the biological parents of schizophrenics to be more disturbed than the other two groups between whom there was no difference in psychopathology With analysis of the Rorschach tests the
schizophrenia,A sample of schizophrenic patients who had been admitted to the University Psychiatric Clinic between 1945 and 1959 was systematically followed up between 1967 and 1973 The same welldefined diagnostic criteria were used throughout the study At the time of the last followup the average duration of illness was years Twentytwo percent of the patients showed complete psychopathological remissions had noncharacteristic types of remission and percent suffered from characteristic schizophrenic deficiency syndromes Psychopathological outcome in the patients studied was assessed in relationship to such factors as duration of illness social remission family history of schizophrenia primary personality educational level social class age at onset and presence of precipitating factors It is concluded that prognostic predictions are possible only when several factors with a similar influence on longterm outcome occur in combination and when factors with a contrary prognostic influence are absent Even under these circumstances the individual course is by
schizophrenia,The KSV model of the schizophrenias proposes that up to of schizophrenics have a pathogenic allele or abnormal expression of the KALIG gene which is located at Xp22 This gene encodes a nervecell adhesion molecule NCAM like protein and is deleted in of patients with Kallmanns syndrome anosmia with secondary hypogonadism Although superficially distinct the schizophrenias and Kallmanns syndrome show numerous parallel trait defects which occur with a similar sex distribution These defects are usually more profound in Kallmanns syndrome Occasionally Kallmanns patients exhibit additional defects such as ichthyosis which are due to the further deletion or translocation of adjacent genes Since schizophrenics exhibit virtually all known trait defects in Kallmanns except these it suggests that the aberrant genes are defective but not deleted in schizophrenia It also appears that compensatory mechanisms involving serine proteases are active in schizophrenia which largely preserve fertility but at the expense of an increased
schizophrenia,IntroductionToxoplasma gondii is the most common protozoan parasite in developed nations Up to of the French population may be infected depending on eating habits and exposure to cats and almost one third of the world humans population may be infected Two types of infection have been described a congenital form and an acquired form Although the medical profession treats these latent cases as asymptomatic and clinically unimportant results of animal studies and recent studies of personality profiles behavior and psychomotor performance have led to reconsider this assumptionPreclinical dataAmong rats parasite cysts are more abundant in amygdalar structures than those found in other regions of the brain Infection does not influence locomotion anxiety hippocampaldependent learning fear conditioning or its extinction and neophobia in rats Rats natural predator is the cat which is also T gondiis reservoir Naturally rats have an aversion to cat urine but the parasite suppresses this aversion in

schizophrenia,ObjectiveTo achieve a better understanding of the functional mechanisms underlying episodic memory dysfunction in schizophrenia which is a prerequisite for unravelling schizophrenias neural correlates in neuroimaging studies and more generally for developing an integrated approach to the pathophysiology of schizophrenia It is also crucial for developing cognitive remediationMethodThis paper reviews empirical evidence of episodic memory dysfunction in schizophrenia obtained with reference to various theoretical models of episodic memoryResultsAll the studies converge to show a significant impairment of the critical feature of episodic memory conscious recollection Schizophrenia is also associated with a defect of autobiographical memory The episodic memory dysfunction results from a predominant failure of strategic processing at encoding although an impairment of strategic processing at retrieval cannot be ruled out The possibility that it is not the execution of the encoding strategies that is defective but rather their selfinitiation by the patients is plausibleConclusionsThese findings may explain some behavioural
